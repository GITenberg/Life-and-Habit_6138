<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> Samuel Butler published
&ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; thirty-three <a
name="citationvii"></a><a href="#footnotevii"
class="citation">[vii]</a> years have elapsed&mdash;years
fruitful in change and discovery, during which many of the mighty
have been put down from their seat and many of the humble have
been exalted.&nbsp; I do not know that Butler can truthfully be
called humble, indeed, I think he had very few misgivings as to
his ultimate triumph, but he has certainly been exalted with a
rapidity that he himself can scarcely have foreseen.&nbsp; During
his lifetime he was a literary pariah, the victim of an organized
conspiracy of silence.&nbsp; He is now, I think it may be said
without exaggeration, universally accepted as one of the most
remarkable English writers of the latter part of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; I will not weary my readers by quoting the
numerous tributes paid by distinguished contemporary writers to
Butler&rsquo;s originality and force of mind, but I cannot
refrain from illustrating the changed attitude of the scientific
world to Butler and his theories by a reference to &ldquo;Darwin
and Modern Science,&rdquo; the collection of essays published in
1909 by the University of Cambridge, in commemoration of the
Darwin centenary.&nbsp; In that work Professor Bateson, while
referring repeatedly to Butler&rsquo;s biological works, speaks
of him as &ldquo;the most brilliant and by far the most
interesting of Darwin&rsquo;s opponents, whose works are at
length emerging from oblivion.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>With the
growth of Butler&rsquo;s reputation &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo;
has had much to do.&nbsp; It was the first and is undoubtedly the
most important of his writings on evolution.&nbsp; From its
loins, as it were, sprang his three later books, &ldquo;Evolution
Old and New,&rdquo; &ldquo;Unconscious Memory,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Luck or Cunning&rdquo;, which carried its arguments
further afield.&nbsp; It will perhaps interest Butler&rsquo;s
readers if I here quote a passage from his note-books, lately
published in the &ldquo;New Quarterly Review&rdquo; (Vol. III.
No. 9), in which he summarizes his work in biology:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me it seems that my contributions to the theory of
evolution have been mainly these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; The identification of heredity and memory, and
the corollaries relating to sports, the reversion to remote
ancestors, the phenomena of old age, the causes of the sterility
of hybrids, and the principles underlying longevity&mdash;all of
which follow as a matter of course.&nbsp; This was &lsquo;Life
and Habit&rsquo; [1877].</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; The re-introduction of teleology into organic
life, which to me seems hardly, if at all, less important than
the &lsquo;Life and Habit&rsquo; theory.&nbsp; This was
&lsquo;Evolution Old and New&rsquo; [1879].</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; An attempt to suggest an explanation of the
physics of memory.&nbsp; This was Unconscious Memory&rsquo;
[1880].&nbsp; I was alarmed by the suggestion and fathered it
upon Professor Hering, who never, that I can see, meant to say
anything of the kind, but I forced my view upon him, as it were,
by taking hold of a sentence or two in his lecture, &lsquo;On
Memory as a Universal Function of Organised Matter,&rsquo; and
thus connected memory with vibrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want to do now (1885) is to connect vibrations
not only with memory but with the physical constitution of that
body in which the memory resides, <a name="pageix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>thus adopting Newland&rsquo;s law
(sometimes called Mendelejeff&rsquo;s law) that there is only one
substance, and that the characteristics of the vibrations going
on within it at any given time will determine whether it will
appear to us as, we will say, hydrogen, or sodium, or chicken
doing this, or chicken doing the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; [This is
touched upon in the concluding chapter of &ldquo;Luck or
Cunning?&rdquo; 1887].</p>
<p>The present edition of &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; is
practically a re-issue of that of 1878.&nbsp; I find that about
the year 1890, although the original edition was far from being
exhausted, Butler began to make corrections of the text of
&ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; presumably with the intention of
publishing a revised edition.&nbsp; The copy of the book so
corrected is now in my possession.&nbsp; In the first five
chapters there are numerous emendations, very few of which,
however, affect the meaning to any appreciable extent, being
mainly concerned with the excision of redundancies and the
simplification of style.&nbsp; I imagine that by the time he had
reached the end of the fifth chapter Butler realised that the
corrections he had made were not of sufficient importance to
warrant a new edition, and determined to let the book stand as it
was.&nbsp; I believe, therefore, that I am carrying out his
wishes in reprinting the present edition from the original
plates.&nbsp; I have found, however, among his papers three
entirely new passages, which he probably wrote during the period
of correction and no doubt intended to incorporate into the
revised edition.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Festing Jones has also given me
a copy of a passage which Butler wrote and gummed into Mr.
Jones&rsquo;s copy of &ldquo;Life and Habit.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
four passages I have printed as an appendix at the end of the
present volume.</p>
<p><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>One more
point deserves notice.&nbsp; Butler often refers in &ldquo;Life
and Habit&rdquo; to Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Variations of Animals
and Plants under Domestication.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he does so it
is always under the name &ldquo;Plants and Animals.&rdquo;&nbsp;
More often still he refers to Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Origin of
Species by means Natural Selection,&rdquo; terming it at one time
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; and at another &ldquo;Natural
Selection,&rdquo; sometimes, as on p. 278, using both names
within a few lines of each other.&nbsp; Butler was as a rule
scrupulously careful about quotations, and I can offer no
explanation of this curious confusion of titles.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Italics in the passages quoted
in this book are generally mine, but I found it almost impossible
to call the reader&rsquo;s attention to this upon every
occasion.&nbsp; I have done so once or twice, as thinking it
necessary in these cases that there should be no mistake; on the
whole, however, I thought it better to content myself with
calling attention in a preface to the fact that the author quoted
is not, as a general rule, responsible for the Italics.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON CERTAIN ACQUIRED HABITS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be our business in the
following chapters to consider whether the unconsciousness, or
quasi-unconsciousness, with which we perform certain acquired
actions, would seem to throw any light upon Embryology and
inherited instincts, and otherwise to follow the train of thought
which the class of actions above-mentioned would suggest; more
especially in so far as they appear to bear upon the origin of
species and the continuation of life by successive generations,
whether in the animal or vegetable kingdoms.</p>
<p>In the outset, however, I would wish most distinctly to
disclaim for these pages the smallest pretension to scientific
value, originality, or even to accuracy of more than a very rough
and ready kind&mdash;for unless a matter be true enough to stand
a good deal of misrepresentation, its truth is not of a very
robust order, and the blame will rather lie with its own delicacy
if it be crushed, than with the carelessness of the
crusher.&nbsp; I have no wish to instruct, and not much to be
instructed; my aim is simply to entertain and interest the
numerous class of people who, like myself, know nothing of
science, but who enjoy speculating and reflecting (not too
deeply) upon the phenomena around them.&nbsp; I have therefore
allowed myself a loose rein, to run on with whatever came
uppermost, without regard to whether it was new or old; feeling
sure that if true, it must be very old or it never could have
occurred to one so little versed in science as myself; and
knowing that it is sometimes pleasanter to meet the old under
slightly changed conditions, than to go through the formalities
and uncertainties of making new acquaintance.&nbsp; At the same
time, I should say that whatever I have knowingly taken from any
one else, I have always acknowledged.</p>
<p>It is plain, therefore, that my book cannot be intended for
the perusal of scientific people; it is intended for the general
public only, with whom I believe myself to be in harmony, as
knowing neither much more nor much less than they do.</p>
<p>Taking then, the art of playing the piano as an example of the
kind of action we are in search of, we observe that a practised
player will perform very difficult pieces apparently without
effort, often, indeed, while thinking and talking of something
quite other than his music; yet he will play accurately and,
possibly, with much expression.&nbsp; If he has been playing a
fugue, say in four parts, he will have kept each part well
distinct, in such a manner as to prove that his mind was not
prevented, by its other occupations, from consciously or
unconsciously following four distinct trains of musical thought
at the same time, nor from making his fingers act in exactly the
required manner as regards each note of each part.</p>
<p>It commonly happens that in the course of four or five minutes
a player may have struck four or five thousand notes.&nbsp; If we
take into consideration the rests, dotted notes, accidentals,
variations of time, &amp;c., we shall find his attention must
have been exercised on many more occasions than when he was
actually striking notes: so that it may not be too much to say
that the attention of a first-rate player may have been
exercised&mdash;to an infinitesimally small extent&mdash;but
still truly exercised&mdash;on as many as ten thousand occasions
within the space of five minutes, for no note can be struck nor
point attended to without a certain amount of attention, no
matter how rapidly or unconsciously given.</p>
<p>Moreover, each act of attention has been followed by an act of
volition, and each act of volition by a muscular action, which is
composed of many minor actions; some so small that we can no more
follow them than the player himself can perceive them;
nevertheless, it may have been perfectly plain that the player
was not attending to what he was doing, but was listening to
conversation on some other subject, not to say joining in it
himself.&nbsp; If he has been playing the violin, he may have
done all the above, and may also have been walking about.&nbsp;
Herr Joachim would unquestionably be able to do all that has here
been described.</p>
<p>So complete would the player&rsquo;s unconsciousness of the
attention he is giving, and the brain power he is exerting appear
to be, that we shall find it difficult to awaken his attention to
any particular part of his performance without putting him
out.&nbsp; Indeed we cannot do so.&nbsp; We shall observe that he
finds it hardly less difficult to compass a voluntary
consciousness of what he has once learnt so thoroughly that it
has passed, so to speak, into the domain of unconsciousness, than
he found it to learn the note or passage in the first
instance.&nbsp; The effort after a second consciousness of detail
baffles him&mdash;compels him to turn to his music or play
slowly.&nbsp; In fact it seems as though he knew the piece too
well to be able to know that he knows it, and is only conscious
of knowing those passages which he does not know so
thoroughly.</p>
<p>At the end of his performance, his memory would appear to be
no less annihilated than was his consciousness of attention and
volition.&nbsp; For of the thousands of acts requiring the
exercise of both the one and the other, which he has done during
the five minutes, we will say, of his performance, he will
remember hardly one when it is over.&nbsp; If he calls to mind
anything beyond the main fact that he has played such and such a
piece, it will probably be some passage which he has found more
difficult than the others, and with the like of which he has not
been so long familiar.&nbsp; All the rest he will forget as
completely as the breath which he has drawn while playing.</p>
<p>He finds it difficult to remember even the difficulties he
experienced in learning to play.&nbsp; A few may have so
impressed him that they remain with him, but the greater part
will have escaped him as completely as the remembrance of what he
ate, or how he put on his clothes, this day ten years ago;
nevertheless, it is plain he remembers more than he remembers
remembering, for he avoids mistakes which he made at one time,
and his performance proves that all the notes are in his memory,
though if called upon to play such and such a bar at random from
the middle of the piece, and neither more nor less, he will
probably say that he cannot remember it unless he begins from the
beginning of the phrase which leads to it.&nbsp; Very commonly he
will be obliged to begin from the beginning of the movement
itself, and be unable to start at any other point unless he have
the music before him; and if disturbed, as we have seen above, he
will have to start <i>de novo</i> from an accustomed
starting-point.</p>
<p>Yet nothing can be more obvious than that there must have been
a time when what is now so easy as to be done without conscious
effort of the brain was only done by means of brain work which
was very keenly perceived, even to fatigue and positive
distress.&nbsp; Even now, if the player is playing something the
like of which he has not met before, we observe he pauses and
becomes immediately conscious of attention.</p>
<p>We draw the inference, therefore, as regards pianoforte or
violin playing, that the more the familiarity or knowledge of the
art, the less is there consciousness of such knowledge; even so
far as that there should seem to be almost as much difficulty in
awakening consciousness which has become, so to speak,
latent,&mdash;a consciousness of that which is known too well to
admit of recognised self-analysis while the knowledge is being
exercised&mdash;as in creating a consciousness of that which is
not yet well enough known to be properly designated as known at
all.&nbsp; On the other hand, we observe that the less the
familiarly or knowledge, the greater the consciousness of
whatever knowledge there is.</p>
<p>Considering other like instances of the habitual exercise of
intelligence and volition, which, from long familiarity with the
method of procedure, escape the notice of the person exercising
them, we naturally think of writing.&nbsp; The formation of each
letter requires attention and volition, yet in a few minutes a
practised writer will form several hundred letters, and be able
to think and talk of something else all the time he is doing
so.&nbsp; It will not probably remember the formation of a single
character in any page that he has written; nor will he be able to
give more than the substance of his writing if asked to do
so.&nbsp; He knows how to form each letter so well, and he knows
so well each word that he is about to write, that he has ceased
to be conscious of his knowledge or to notice his acts of
volition, each one of which is, nevertheless, followed by a
corresponding muscular action.&nbsp; Yet the uniformity of our
handwriting, and the manner in which we almost invariably adhere
to one method of forming the same character, would seem to
suggest that during the momentary formation of each letter our
memories must revert (with an intensity too rapid for our
perception) to many if not to all the occasions on which we have
ever written the same letter previously&mdash;the memory of these
occasions dwelling in our minds as what has been called a
residuum&mdash;an unconsciously struck balance or average of them
all&mdash;a fused mass of individual reminiscences of which no
trace can be found in our consciousness, and of which the only
effect would seem to lie in the gradual changes of handwriting
which are perceptible in most people till they have reached
middle-age, and sometimes even later.&nbsp; So far are we from
consciously remembering any one of the occasions on which we have
written such and such a letter, that we are not even conscious of
exercising our memory at all, any more than we are in health
conscious of the action of our heart.&nbsp; But, if we are
writing in some unfamiliar way, as when printing our letters
instead of writing them in our usual running hand, our memory is
so far awakened that we become conscious of every character we
form; sometimes it is even perceptible as memory to ourselves, as
when we try to remember how to print some letter, for example a
g, and cannot call to mind on which side of the upper half of the
letter we ought to put the link which connects it with the lower,
and are successful in remembering; but if we become very
conscious of remembering, it shows that we are on the brink of
only trying to remember,&mdash;that is to say, of not remembering
at all.</p>
<p>As a general rule, we remember for a time the substance of
what we have written, for the subject is generally new to us; but
if we are writing what we have often written before, we lose
consciousness of this too, as fully as we do of the characters
necessary to convey the substance to another person, and we shall
find ourselves writing on as it were mechanically while thinking
and talking of something else.&nbsp; So a paid copyist, to whom
the subject of what he is writing is of no importance, does not
even notice it.&nbsp; He deals only with familiar words and
familiar characters without caring to go behind them, and
thereupon writes on in a quasi-unconscious manner; but if he
comes to a word or to characters with which he is but little
acquainted, he becomes immediately awakened to the consciousness
of either remembering or trying to remember.&nbsp; His
consciousness of his own knowledge or memory would seem to belong
to a period, so to speak, of twilight between the thick darkness
of ignorance and the brilliancy of perfect knowledge; as colour
which vanishes with extremes of light or of shade.&nbsp; Perfect
ignorance and perfect knowledge are alike unselfconscious.</p>
<p>The above holds good even more noticeably in respect of
reading.&nbsp; How many thousands of individual letters do our
eyes run over every morning in the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; newspaper,
how few of them do we notice, or remember having noticed?&nbsp;
Yet there was a time when we had such difficulty in reading even
the simplest words, that we had to take great pains to impress
them upon our memory so as to know them when we came to then
again.&nbsp; Now, not even a single word of all we have seen will
remain with us, unless it is a new one, or an old one used in an
unfamiliar sense, in which case we notice, and may very likely
remember it.&nbsp; Our memory retains the substance only, the
substance only being unfamiliar.&nbsp; Nevertheless, although we
do not perceive more than the general result of our perception,
there can be no doubt of our having perceived every letter in
every word that we have read at all, for if we come upon a word
misspelt our attention is at once aroused; unless, indeed, we
have actually corrected the misspelling, as well as noticed it,
unconsciously, through exceeding familiarity with the way in
which it ought to be spelt.&nbsp; Not only do we perceive the
letters we have seen without noticing that we have perceived
them, but we find it almost impossible to notice that we notice
them when we have once learnt to read fluently.&nbsp; To try to
do so puts us out, and prevents our being able to read.&nbsp; We
may even go so far as to say that if a man can attend to the
individual characters, it is a sign that he cannot yet read
fluently.&nbsp; If we know how to read well, we are as
unconscious of the means and processes whereby we attain the
desired result as we are about the growth of our hair or the
circulation of our blood.&nbsp; So that here again it would seem
that we only know what we know still to some extent imperfectly,
and that what we know thoroughly escapes our conscious perception
though none the less actually perceived.&nbsp; Our perception in
fact passes into a latent stage, as also our memory and
volition.</p>
<p>Walking is another example of the rapid exercise of volition
with but little perception of each individual act of
exercise.&nbsp; We notice any obstacle in our path, but it is
plain we do not notice that we perceive much that we have
nevertheless been perceiving; for if a man goes down a lane by
night he will stumble over many things which he would have
avoided by day, although he would not have noticed them.&nbsp;
Yet time was when walking was to each one of us a new and arduous
task&mdash;as arduous as we should now find it to wheel a
wheelbarrow on a tight-rope; whereas, at present, though we can
think of our steps to a certain extent without checking our power
to walk, we certainly cannot consider our muscular action in
detail without having to come to a dead stop.</p>
<p>Talking&mdash;especially in one&rsquo;s mother
tongue&mdash;may serve as a last example.&nbsp; We find it
impossible to follow the muscular action of the mouth and tongue
in framing every letter or syllable we utter.&nbsp; We have
probably spoken for years and years before we became aware that
the letter h is a labial sound, and until we have to utter a word
which is difficult from its unfamiliarity we speak
&ldquo;trippingly on the tongue&rdquo; with no attention except
to the substance of what we wish to say.&nbsp; Yet talking was
not always the easy matter to us which it is at present&mdash;as
we perceive more readily when we are learning a new language
which it may take us months to master.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when
we have once mastered it we speak it without further
consciousness of knowledge or memory, as regards the more common
words, and without even noticing our consciousness.&nbsp; Here,
as in the other instances already given, as long as we did not
know perfectly, we were conscious of our acts of perception,
volition, and reflection, but when our knowledge has become
perfect we no longer notice our consciousness, nor our volition;
nor can we awaken a second artificial consciousness without some
effort, and disturbance of the process of which we are
endeavouring to become conscious.&nbsp; We are no longer, so to
speak, under the law, but under grace.</p>
<p>An ascending scale may be perceived in the above
instances.</p>
<p>In playing, we have an action acquired long after birth,
difficult of acquisition, and never thoroughly familiarised to
the power of absolutely unconscious performance, except in the
case of those who have either an exceptional genius for music, or
who have devoted the greater part of their time to
practising.&nbsp; Except in the case of these persons it is
generally found easy to become more or less conscious of any
passage without disturbing the performance, and our action
remains so completely within our control that we can stop playing
at any moment we please.</p>
<p>In writing, we have an action generally acquired earlier, done
for the most part with great unconsciousness of detail, fairly
well within our control to stop at any moment; though not so
completely as would be imagined by those who have not made the
experiment of trying to stop in the middle of a given character
when writing at fit speed.&nbsp; Also, we can notice our
formation of any individual character without our writing being
materially hindered.</p>
<p>Reading is usually acquired earlier still.&nbsp; We read with
more unconsciousness of attention than we write.&nbsp; We find it
more difficult to become conscious of any character without
discomfiture, and we cannot arrest ourselves in the middle of a
word, for example, and hardly before the end of a sentence;
nevertheless it is on the whole well within our control.</p>
<p>Walking is so early an acquisition that we cannot remember
having acquired it.&nbsp; In running fast over average ground we
find it very difficult to become conscious of each individual
step, and should possibly find it more difficult still, if the
inequalities and roughness of uncultured land had not perhaps
caused the development of a power to create a second
consciousness of our steps without hindrance to our running or
walking.&nbsp; Pursuit and flight, whether in the chase or in
war, must for many generations have played a much more prominent
part in the lives of our ancestors than they do in our own.&nbsp;
If the ground over which they had to travel had been generally as
free from obstruction as our modern cultivated lands, it is
possible that we might not find it as easy to notice our several
steps as we do at present.&nbsp; Even as it is, if while we are
running we would consider the action of our muscles, we come to a
dead stop, and should probably fall if we tried to observe too
suddenly; for we must stop to do this, and running, when we have
once committed ourselves to it beyond a certain point, is not
controllable to a step or two without loss of equilibrium.</p>
<p>We learn to talk, much about the same time that we learn to
walk, but talking requires less muscular effort than walking, and
makes generally less demand upon our powers.&nbsp; A man may talk
a long while before he has done the equivalent of a five-mile
walk; it is natural, therefore, that we should have had more
practice in talking than in walking, and hence that we should
find it harder to pay attention to our words than to our
steps.&nbsp; Certainly it is very hard to become conscious of
every syllable or indeed of every word we say; the attempt to do
so will often bring us to a check at once; nevertheless we can
generally stop talking if we wish to do so, unless the crying of
infants be considered as a kind of <i>quasi</i>-speech: this
comes earlier, and is often quite uncontrollable, or more truly
perhaps is done with such complete control over the muscles by
the will, and with such absolute certainty of his own purpose on
the part of the wilier, that there is no longer any more doubt,
uncertainty, or suspense, and hence no power of perceiving any of
the processes whereby the result is attained&mdash;as a wheel
which may look fast fixed because it is so fast revolving. <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a></p>
<p>We may observe therefore in this ascending scale, imperfect as
it is, that the older the habit the longer the practice, the
longer the practice, the more knowledge&mdash;or, the less
uncertainty; the less uncertainty the less power of conscious
self-analysis and control.</p>
<p>It will occur to the reader that in all the instances given
above, different individuals attain the unconscious stage of
perfect knowledge with very different degrees of facility.&nbsp;
Some have to attain it with a great sum; others are free
born.&nbsp; Some learn to play, to read, write, and talk, with
hardly an effort&mdash;some show such an instinctive aptitude for
arithmetic that, like Zerah Colburn, at eight years old, they
achieve results without instruction, which in the case of most
people would require a long education.&nbsp; The account of Zerah
Colburn, as quoted from Mr. Baily in Dr. Carpenter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Mental Physiology,&rdquo; may perhaps be given here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He raised any number consisting of <i>one</i> figure
progressively to the tenth power, giving the results (by actual
multiplication and not by memory) <i>faster than they could be
set down in figures</i> by the person appointed to record
them.&nbsp; He raised the number 8 progressively to the
<i>sixteenth</i> power, and in naming the last result, which
consisted of 15 figures, he was right in every one.&nbsp; Some
numbers consisting of <i>two</i> figures he raised as high as the
eighth power, though he found a difficulty in proceeding when the
products became very large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On being asked the <i>square root</i> of 106,929, he
answered 327 before the original number could be written
down.&nbsp; He was then required to find the cube root of
268,336,125, and with equal facility and promptness he replied
645.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was asked how many minutes there are in 48 years,
and before the question could be taken down he replied
25,228,800, and immediately afterwards he gave the correct number
of seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On being requested to give the factors which would
produce the number 247,483, he immediately named 941 and 263,
which are the only two numbers from the multiplication of which
it would result.&nbsp; On 171,395 being proposed, he named 5
&times; 34,279, 7 &times; 24,485, 59 &times; 2905, 83 &times;
2065, 35 &times; 4897, 295 &times; 581, and 413 &times; 415.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was then asked to give the factors of 36,083, but he
immediately replied that it had none, which was really the case,
this being a prime number.&nbsp; Other numbers being proposed to
him indiscriminately, he always succeeded in giving the correct
factors except in the case of prime numbers, which he generally
discovered almost as soon as they were proposed to him.&nbsp; The
number 4,294,967,297, which is 2<sup>32</sup> + 1, having been
given him, he discovered, as Euler had previously done, that it
was not the prime number which Fermat had supposed it to be, but
that it is the product of the factors 6,700,417 &times;
641.&nbsp; The solution of this problem was only given after the
lapse of some weeks, but the method he took to obtain it clearly
showed that he had not derived his information from any
extraneous source.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was asked to multiply together numbers both
consisting of more than these figures, he seemed to decompose one
or both of them into its factors, and to work with them
separately.&nbsp; Thus, on being asked to give the square of
4395, he multiplied 293 by itself, and then twice multiplied the
product by 15.&nbsp; And on being asked to tell the square of
999,999 he obtained the correct result, 999,998,000,001, by twice
multiplying the square of 37,037 by 27.&nbsp; He then of his own
accord multiplied that product by 49, and said that the result
(viz., 48,999,902,000,049) was equal to the square of
6,999,993.&nbsp; He afterwards multiplied this product by 49, and
observed that the result (viz., 2,400,995,198,002,401) was equal
to the square of 48,999,951.&nbsp; He was again asked to multiply
the product by 25, and in naming the result (viz.,
60,024,879,950,060,025) he said it was equal to the square of
244,999,755.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On being interrogated as to the manner in which he
obtained these results, the boy constantly said he did not know
<i>how</i> the answers came into his mind.&nbsp; In the act of
multiplying two numbers together, and in the raising of powers,
it was evident (alike from the facts just stated and from the
motion of his lips) that <i>some</i> operation was going forward
in his mind; yet that operation could not (from the readiness
with which his answers were furnished) have been at all allied to
the usual modes of procedure, of which, indeed, he was entirely
ignorant, not being able to perform on paper a simple sum in
multiplication or division.&nbsp; But in the extraction of roots,
and in the discovery of the factors of large numbers, it did not
appear that any operation <i>could</i> take place, since he gave
answers <i>immediately</i>, or in a very few seconds, which,
according to the ordinary methods, would have required very
difficult and laborious calculations, and prime numbers cannot be
recognised as such by any known rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should hope that many of the above figures are wrong.&nbsp;
I have verified them carefully with Dr. Carpenter&rsquo;s
quotation, but further than this I cannot and will not go.&nbsp;
Also I am happy to find that in the end the boy overcame the
mathematics, and turned out a useful but by no means particularly
calculating member of society.</p>
<p>The case, however, is typical of others in which persons have
been found able to do without apparent effort what in the great
majority of cases requires a long apprenticeship.&nbsp; It is
needless to multiply instances; the point that concerns us is,
that knowledge under such circumstances being very intense, and
the ease with which the result is produced extreme, it eludes the
conscious apprehension of the performer himself, who only becomes
conscious when a difficulty arises which taxes even his abnormal
power.&nbsp; Such a case, therefore, confirms rather than
militates against our opinion that consciousness of knowledge
vanishes on the knowledge becoming perfect&mdash;the only
difference between those possessed of any such remarkable special
power and the general run of people being, that the first are
born with such an unusual aptitude for their particular specialty
that they are able to dispense with all or nearly all the
preliminary exercise of their faculty, while the latter must
exercise it for a considerable time before they can get it to
work smoothly and easily; but in either case when once the
knowledge is intense it is unconscious.</p>
<p>Nor again would such an instance as that of Zerah Colburn
warrant us in believing that this white heat, as it were, of
unconscious knowledge can be attained by any one without his ever
having been originally cold.&nbsp; Young Colburn, for example,
could not extract roots when he was an embryo of three
weeks&rsquo; standing.&nbsp; It is true we can seldom follow the
process, but we know there must have been a time in every case
when even the desire for information or action had not been
kindled; the forgetfulness of effort on the part of those with
exceptional genius for a special subject is due to the smallness
of the effort necessary, so that it makes no impression upon the
individual himself, rather than to the absence of any effort at
all. <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>It would, therefore, appear as though perfect knowledge and
perfect ignorance were extremes which meet and become
indistinguishable from one another; so also perfect volition and
perfect absence of volition, perfect memory and utter
forgetfulness; for we are unconscious of knowing, willing, or
remembering, either from not yet having known or willed, or from
knowing and willing so well and so intensely as to be no longer
conscious of either.&nbsp; Conscious knowledge and volition are
of attention; attention is of suspense; suspense is of doubt;
doubt is of uncertainty; uncertainty is of ignorance; so that the
mere fact of conscious knowing or willing implies the presence of
more or less novelty and doubt.</p>
<p>It would also appear as a general principle on a superficial
view of the foregoing instances (and the reader may readily
supply himself with others which are perhaps more to the
purpose), that unconscious knowledge and unconscious volition are
never acquired otherwise than as the result of experience,
familiarity, or habit; so that whenever we observe a person able
to do any complicated action unconsciously, we may assume both
that he must have done it very often before he could acquire so
great proficiency, and also that there must have been a time when
he did not know how to do it at all.</p>
<p>We may assume that there was a time when he was yet so nearly
on the point of neither knowing nor willing perfectly, that he
was quite alive to whatever knowledge or volition he could exert;
going further back, we shall find him still more keenly alive to
a less perfect knowledge; earlier still, we find him well aware
that he does not know nor will correctly, but trying hard to do
both the one and the other; and so on, back and back, till both
difficulty and consciousness become little more than a sound of
going in the brain, a flitting to and fro of something barely
recognisable as the desire to will or know at all&mdash;much less
as the desire to know or will definitely this or that.&nbsp;
Finally, they retreat beyond our ken into the repose&mdash;the
inorganic kingdom&mdash;of as yet unawakened interest.</p>
<p>In either case,&mdash;the repose of perfect ignorance or of
perfect knowledge&mdash;disturbance is troublesome.&nbsp; When
first starting on an Atlantic steamer, our rest is hindered by
the screw; after a short time, it is hindered if the screw
stops.&nbsp; A uniform impression is practically no
impression.&nbsp; One cannot either learn or unlearn without
pains or pain.</p>

20</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS
KNOWERS&mdash;THE LAW AND GRACE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter we shall show that
the law, which we have observed to hold as to the vanishing
tendency of knowledge upon becoming perfect, holds good not only
concerning acquired actions or habits of body, but concerning
opinions, modes of thought, and mental habits generally, which
are no more recognised as soon as firmly fixed, than are the
steps with which we go about our daily avocations.&nbsp; I am
aware that I may appear in the latter part of the chapter to have
wandered somewhat beyond the limits of my subject, but, on the
whole, decide upon leaving what I have written, inasmuch as it
serves to show how far-reaching is the principle on which I am
insisting.&nbsp; Having said so much, I shall during the
remainder of the book keep more closely to the point.</p>
<p>Certain it is that we know best what we are least conscious of
knowing, or at any rate least able to prove, as, for example, our
own existence, or that there is a country England.&nbsp; If any
one asks us for proof on matters of this sort, we have none
ready, and are justly annoyed at being called to consider what we
regard as settled questions.&nbsp; Again, there is hardly
anything which so much affects our actions as the centre of the
earth (unless, perhaps, it be that still hotter and more
unprofitable spot the centre of the universe), for we are
incessantly trying to get as near it as circumstances will allow,
or to avoid getting nearer than is for the time being
convenient.&nbsp; Walking, running, standing, sitting, lying,
waking, or sleeping, from birth till death it is a paramount
object with us; even after death&mdash;if it be not fanciful to
say so&mdash;it is one of the few things of which what is left of
us can still feel the influence; yet what can engross less of our
attention than this dark and distant spot so many thousands of
miles away?</p>
<p>The air we breathe, so long as it is neither too hot nor cold,
nor rough, nor full of smoke&mdash;that is to say, so long as it
is in that state within which we are best acquainted&mdash;seldom
enters into our thoughts; yet there is hardly anything with which
we are more incessantly occupied night and day.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not too much to say that we have no really
profound knowledge upon any subject&mdash;no knowledge on the
strength of which we are ready to act at all moments
unhesitatingly without either preparation or
after-thought&mdash;till we have left off feeling conscious of
the possession of such knowledge, and of the grounds on which it
rests.&nbsp; A lesson thoroughly learned must be like the air
which feels so light, though pressing so heavily against us,
because every pore of our skin is saturated, so to speak, with it
on all sides equally.&nbsp; This perfection of knowledge
sometimes extends to positive disbelief in the thing known, so
that the most thorough knower shall believe himself altogether
ignorant.&nbsp; No thief, for example, is such an utter
thief&mdash;so <i>good</i> a thief&mdash;as the
kleptomaniac.&nbsp; Until he has become a kleptomaniac, and can
steal a horse as it were by a reflex action, he is still but half
a thief, with many unthievish notions still clinging to
him.&nbsp; Yet the kleptomaniac is probably unaware that he can
steal at all, much less that he can steal so well.&nbsp; He would
be shocked if he were to know the truth.&nbsp; So again, no man
is a great hypocrite until he has left off knowing that he is a
hypocrite.&nbsp; The great hypocrites of the world are almost
invariably under the impression that they are among the very few
really honest people to be found and, as we must all have
observed, it is rare to find any one strongly under this
impression without ourselves having good reason to differ from
him.</p>
<p>Our own existence is another case in point.&nbsp; When we have
once become articulately conscious of existing, it is an easy
matter to begin doubting whether we exist at all.&nbsp; As long
as man was too unreflecting a creature to articulate in words his
consciousness of his own existence, he knew very well that he
existed, but he did not know that he knew it.&nbsp; With
introspection, and the perception recognised, for better or
worse, that he was a fact, came also the perception that he had
no solid ground for believing that he was a fact at all.&nbsp;
That nice, sensible, unintrospective people who were too busy
trying to exist pleasantly to trouble their heads as to whether
they existed or no&mdash;that this best part of mankind should
have gratefully caught at such a straw as &ldquo;<i>cogito ergo
sum</i>,&rdquo; is intelligible enough.&nbsp; They felt the
futility of the whole question, and were thankful to one who
seemed to clench the matter with a cant catchword, especially
with a catchword in a foreign language; but how one, who was so
far gone as to recognise that he could not prove his own
existence, should be able to comfort himself with such a begging
of the question, would seem unintelligible except upon the ground
of sheer exhaustion.</p>
<p>At the risk of appearing to wander too far from the matter in
hand, a few further examples may perhaps be given of that irony
of nature, by which it comes about that we so often most know and
are, what we least think ourselves to know and be&mdash;and on
the other hand hold most strongly what we are least capable of
demonstrating.</p>
<p>Take the existence of a Personal God,&mdash;one of the most
profoundly-received and widely-spread ideas that have ever
prevailed among mankind.&nbsp; Has there ever been a
<i>demonstration</i> of the existence of such a God as has
satisfied any considerable section of thinkers for long
together?&nbsp; Hardly has what has been conceived to be a
demonstration made its appearance and received a certain
acceptance as though it were actual proof, when it has been
impugned with sufficient success to show that, however true the
fact itself, the demonstration is naught.&nbsp; I do not say that
this is an argument against the personality of God; the drift,
indeed, of the present reasoning would be towards an opposite
conclusion, inasmuch as it insists upon the fact that what is
most true and best known is often least susceptible of
demonstration owing to the very perfectness with which it is
known; nevertheless, the fact remains that many men in many ages
and countries&mdash;the subtlest thinkers over the whole world
for some fifteen hundred years&mdash;have hunted for a
demonstration of God&rsquo;s personal existence; yet though so
many have sought,&mdash;so many, and so able, and for so long a
time&mdash;none have found.&nbsp; There is no demonstration which
can be pointed to with any unanimity as settling the matter
beyond power of reasonable cavil.&nbsp; On the contrary, it may
be observed that from the attempt to prove the existence of a
personal God to the denial of that existence altogether, the path
is easy.&nbsp; As in the case of our own existence, it will be
found that they alone are perfect believers in a personal Deity
and in the Christian religion who have not yet begun to feel that
either stands in need of demonstration.&nbsp; We observe that
most people, whether Christians, or Jews, or Mohammedans, are
unable to give their reasons for the faith that is in them with
any readiness or completeness; and this is sure proof that they
really hold it so utterly as to have no further sense that it
either can be demonstrated or ought to be so, but feel towards it
as towards the air which they breathe but do not notice.&nbsp; On
the other hand, a living prelate was reported in the
&ldquo;Times&rdquo; to have said in one of his latest charges:
&ldquo;My belief is that a widely extended good practice must be
founded upon Christian doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fact of the
Archbishop&rsquo;s recognising this as among the number of his
beliefs is conclusive evidence with those who have devoted
attention to the laws of thought, that his mind is not yet clear
as to whether or no there is any connection at all between
Christian doctrine and widely extended good practice. <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a></p>
<p>Again, it has been often and very truly said that it is not
the conscious and self-styled sceptic, as Shelley for example,
who is the true unbeliever.&nbsp; Such a man as Shelley will, as
indeed his life abundantly proves, have more in common than not
with the true unselfconscious believer.&nbsp; Gallio again, whose
indifference to religious animosities has won him the cheapest
immortality which, so far as I can remember, was ever yet won,
was probably if the truth were known, a person of the sincerest
piety.&nbsp; It is the unconscious unbeliever who is the true
infidel, however greatly he would be surprised to know the
truth.&nbsp; Mr. Spurgeon was reported as having recently asked
the Almighty to &ldquo;change our rulers <i>as soon as
possible</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There lurks a more profound distrust
of God&rsquo;s power in these words than in almost any open
denial of His existence.</p>
<p>So it rather shocks us to find Mr. Darwin writing
(&ldquo;Plants and Animals under Domestication,&rdquo; vol. ii.,
p. 275): &ldquo;No doubt, in every case there must have been some
exciting cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, six or seven pages later:
&ldquo;No doubt, each slight variation must have its efficient
cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; The repetition within so short a space of
this expression of confidence in the impossibility of causeless
effects would suggest that Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s mind at the time of
writing was, unconsciously to himself, in a state of more or less
uneasiness as to whether effects could not occasionally come
about of themselves, and without cause of any sort,&mdash;that he
may have been standing, in fact, for a short time upon the brink
of a denial of the indestructibility of force and matter.</p>
<p>In like manner, the most perfect humour and irony is generally
quite unconscious.&nbsp; Examples of both are frequently given by
men whom the world considers as deficient in humour; it is more
probably true that these persons are unconscious of their own
delightful power through the very mastery and perfection with
which they hold it.&nbsp; There is a play, for instance, of
genuine fun in some of the more serious scientific and
theological journals which for some time past we have looked for
in vain in &ldquo;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following extract, from a journal which I will not
advertise, may serve as an example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lycurgus, when they had abandoned to his revenge him
who had put out his eyes, took him home, and the punishment he
inflicted upon him was sedulous instructions to
virtue.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet this truly comic paper does not probably
know that it is comic, any more than the kleptomaniac knows that
he steals, or than John Milton knew he was a humorist when he
wrote a hymn upon the circumcision, and spent his honeymoon in
composing a treatise on divorce.&nbsp; No more again did Goethe
know how exquisitely humorous he was when he wrote, in his
Wilhelm Meister, that a beautiful tear glistened in
Theresa&rsquo;s right eye, and then went on to explain that it
glistened in her right eye and not in her left, because she had
had a wart on her left which had been removed&mdash;and
successfully.&nbsp; Goethe probably wrote this without a chuckle;
he believed what a good many people who have never read Wilhelm
Meister believe still, namely, that it was a work full of pathos,
of fine and tender feeling; yet a less consummate humorist must
have felt that there was scarcely a paragraph in it from first to
last the chief merit of which did not lie in its absurdity.</p>
<p>Another example may be taken from Bacon of the manner in which
sayings which drop from men unconsciously, give the key of their
inner thoughts to another person, though they themselves know not
that they have such thoughts at all; much less that these
thoughts are their only true convictions.&nbsp; In his Essay on
Friendship the great philosopher writes: &ldquo;Reading good
books on morality is a little flat and dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Innocent, not to say pathetic, as this passage may sound it is
pregnant with painful inferences concerning Bacon&rsquo;s moral
character.&nbsp; For if he knew that he found reading good books
of morality a little flat and dead, it follows he must have tried
to read them; nor is he saved by the fact that he found them a
little flat and dead; for though this does indeed show that he
had begun to be so familiar with a few first principles as to
find it more or less exhausting to have his attention directed to
them further&mdash;yet his words prove that they were not so
incorporate with him that he should feel the loathing for further
discourse upon the matter which honest people commonly feel
now.&nbsp; It will be remembered that he took bribes when he came
to be Lord Chancellor.</p>
<p>It is on the same principle that we find it so distasteful to
hear one praise another for earnestness.&nbsp; For such praise
raises a suspicion in our minds (<i>pace</i> the late Dr. Arnold
and his following) that the praiser&rsquo;s attention must have
been arrested by sincerity, as by something more or less
unfamiliar to himself.&nbsp; So universally is this recognised
that the world has for some time been discarded entirely by all
reputable people.&nbsp; Truly, if there is one who cannot find
himself in the same room with the life and letters of an earnest
person without being made instantly unwell, the same is a just
man and perfect in all his ways.</p>
<p>But enough has perhaps been said.&nbsp; As the fish in the
sea, or the bird in the air, so unreasoningly and inarticulately
safe must a man feel before he can be said to know.&nbsp; It is
only those who are ignorant and uncultivated who can know
anything at all in a proper sense of the words.&nbsp; Cultivation
will breed in any man a certainty of the uncertainty even of his
most assured convictions.&nbsp; It is perhaps fortunate for our
comfort that we can none of us be cultivated upon very many
subjects, so that considerable scope for assurance will still
remain to us; but however this may be, we certainly observe it as
a fact that the greatest men are they who are most uncertain in
spite of certainty, and at the same time most certain in spite of
uncertainty, and who are thus best able to feel that there is
nothing in such complete harmony with itself as a flat
contradiction in terms.&nbsp; For nature hates that any principle
should breed, so to speak, hermaphroditically, but will give to
each an help meet for it which shall cross it and be the undoing
of it; as in the case of descent with modification, of which the
essence would appear to be that every offspring should resemble
its parents, and yet, at the same time, that no offspring should
resemble its parents.&nbsp; But for the slightly irritating
stimulant of this perpetual crossing, we should pass our lives
unconsciously as though in slumber.</p>
<p>Until we have got to understand that though black is not
white, yet it may be whiter than white itself (and any painter
will readily paint that which shall show obviously as black, yet
it shall be whiter than that which shall show no less obviously
as white), we may be good logicians, but we are still poor
reasoners.&nbsp; Knowledge is in an inchoate state as long as it
is capable of logical treatment; it must be transmuted into that
sense or instinct which rises altogether above the sphere in
which words can have being at all, otherwise it is not yet
vital.&nbsp; For sense is to knowledge what conscience is to
reasoning about right and wrong; the reasoning must be so rapid
as to defy conscious reference to first principles, and even at
times to be apparently subversive of them altogether, or the
action will halt.&nbsp; It must, in fact, become automatic before
we are safe with it.&nbsp; While we are fumbling for the grounds
of our conviction, our conviction is prone to fall, as Peter for
lack of faith sinking into the waves of Galilee; so that the very
power to prove at all is an <i>&agrave; priori</i> argument
against the truth&mdash;or at any rate the practical importance
to the vast majority of mankind&mdash;of all that is supported by
demonstration.&nbsp; For the power to prove implies a sense of
the need of proof, and things which the majority of mankind find
practically important are in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
above proof.&nbsp; The need of proof becomes as obsolete in the
case of assumed knowledge, as the practice of fortifying towns in
the middle of an old and long settled country.&nbsp; Who builds
defences for that which is impregnable or little likely to be
assailed?&nbsp; The answer is ready, that unless the defences had
been built in former times it would be impossible to do without
them now; but this does not touch the argument, which is not that
demonstration is unwise, but that as long as a demonstration is
still felt necessary, and therefore kept ready to hand, the
subject of such demonstration is not yet securely known.&nbsp;
<i>Qui s&rsquo;excuse</i>, <i>s&rsquo;accuse</i>; and unless a
matter can hold its own without the brag and self-assertion of
continual demonstration, it is still more or less of a parvenu,
which we shall not lose much by neglecting till it has less
occasion to blow its own trumpet.&nbsp; The only alternative is
that it is an error in process of detection, for if evidence
concerning any opinion has long been denied superfluous, and ever
after this comes to be again felt necessary, we know that the
opinion is doomed.</p>
<p>If there is any truth in the above, it should follow that our
conception of the words &ldquo;science&rdquo; and
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; should undergo some modification.&nbsp;
Not that we should speak slightingly of science, but that we
should recognise more than we do, that there are two distinct
classes of scientific people corresponding not inaptly with the
two main parties unto which the political world is divided.&nbsp;
The one class is deeply versed in those sciences which have
already become the common property of mankind; enjoying,
enforcing, perpetuating, and engraving still more deeply unto the
mind of man acquisitions already approved by common experience,
but somewhat careless about extension of empire, or at any rate
disinclined, for the most part, to active effort on their own
part for the sake of such extension&mdash;neither progressive, in
fact, nor aggressive&mdash;but quiet, peaceable people, who wish
to live and let live, as their fathers before them; while the
other class is chiefly intent upon pushing forward the boundaries
of science, and is comparatively indifferent to what is known
already save in so far as necessary for purposes of
extension.&nbsp; These last are called pioneers of science, and
to them alone is the title &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; commonly
accorded; but pioneers, unimportant to an army as they are, are
still not the army itself; which can get on better without the
pioneers than the pioneers without the army.&nbsp; Surely the
class which knows thoroughly well what it knows, and which
adjudicates upon the value of the discoveries made by the
pioneers&mdash;surely this class has as good a right or better to
be called scientific than the pioneers themselves.</p>
<p>These two classes above described blend into one another with
every shade of gradation.&nbsp; Some are admirably proficient in
the well-known sciences&mdash;that is to say, they have good
health, good looks, good temper, common sense, and energy, and
they hold all these good things in such perfection as to lie
altogether without introspection&mdash;to be not under the law,
but so utterly and entirely under grace that every one who sees
them likes them.&nbsp; But such may, and perhaps more commonly
will, have very little inclination to extend the boundaries of
human knowledge; their aim is in another direction
altogether.&nbsp; Of the pioneers, on the other hand, some are
agreeable people, well versed in the older sciences, though still
more eminent as pioneers, while others, whose services in this
last capacity have been of inestimable value, are noticeably
ignorant of the sciences which have already become current with
the larger part of mankind&mdash;in other words, they are ugly,
rude, and disagreeable people, very progressive, it may be, but
very aggressive to boot.</p>
<p>The main difference between these two classes lies in the fact
that the knowledge of the one, so far as it is new, is known
consciously, while that of the other is unconscious, consisting
of sense and instinct rather than of recognised knowledge.&nbsp;
So long as a man has these, and of the same kind as the more
powerful body of his fellow-countrymen, he is a true man of
science, though he can hardly read or write.&nbsp; As my great
namesake said so well, &ldquo;He knows what&rsquo;s what, and
that&rsquo;s as high as metaphysic wit can fly.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
usual, these true and thorough knowers do not know that they are
scientific, and can seldom give a reason for the faith that is in
them.&nbsp; They believe themselves to be ignorant, uncultured
men, nor can even the professors whom they sometimes outwit in
their own professorial domain perceive that they have been
outwitted by men of superior scientific attainments to their
own.&nbsp; The following passage from Dr. Carpenter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Mesmerism, Spiritualism,&rdquo; &amp;c., may serve as an
illustration:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well known that persons who are conversant with
the geological structure of a district are often able to indicate
with considerable certainty in what spot and at what depth water
will be found; and men <i>of less scientific knowledge</i>,
<i>but of considerable practical experience</i>&rdquo;&mdash;(so
that in Dr. Carpenter&rsquo;s mind there seems to be some sort of
contrast or difference in kind between the knowledge which is
derived from observation of facts and scientific
knowledge)&mdash;&ldquo;frequently arrive at a true conclusion
upon this point without being able to assign reasons for their
opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly the same may be said in regard to the mineral
structure of a mining district; the course of a metallic vein
being often correctly indicated by the shrewd guess of an
<i>observant</i> workman, when <i>the scientific reasoning</i> of
the mining engineer altogether fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Precisely.&nbsp; Here we have exactly the kind of thing we are
in search of: the man who has observed and observed till the
facts are so thoroughly in his head that through familiarity he
has lost sight both of them and of the processes whereby he
deduced his conclusions from them&mdash;is apparently not
considered scientific, though he knows how to solve the problem
before him; the mining engineer, on the other hand, who reasons
scientifically&mdash;that is to say, with a knowledge of his own
knowledge&mdash;is found not to know, and to fail in discovering
the mineral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an experience we are continually encountering in
other walks of life,&rdquo; continues Dr. Carpenter, &ldquo;that
particular persons are guided&mdash;some apparently by an
original and others by <i>an acquired intuition</i>&mdash;to
conclusions for which they can give no adequate reason, but which
subsequent events prove to have been correct.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
this, I take it, implies what I have been above insisting on,
namely, that on becoming intense, knowledge seems also to become
unaware of the grounds on which it rests, or that it has or
requires grounds at all, or indeed even exists.&nbsp; The only
issue between myself and Dr. Carpenter would appear to be, that
Dr. Carpenter, himself an acknowledged leader in the scientific
world, restricts the term &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; to the people
who know that they know, but are beaten by those who are not so
conscious of their own knowledge; while I say that the term
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; should be applied (only that they would
not like it) to the nice sensible people who know what&rsquo;s
what rather than to the discovering class.</p>
<p>And this is easily understood when we remember that the
pioneer cannot hope to acquire any of the new sciences in a
single lifetime so perfectly as to become unaware of his own
knowledge.&nbsp; As a general rule, we observe him to be still in
a state of active consciousness concerning whatever particular
science he is extending, and as long as he is in this state he
cannot know utterly.&nbsp; It is, as I have already so often
insisted on, those who do not know that they know so much who
have the firmest grip of their knowledge: the best class, for
example, of our English youth, who live much in the open air,
and, as Lord Beaconsfield finely said, never read.&nbsp; These
are the people who know best those things which are best worth
knowing&mdash;that is to say, they are the most truly
scientific.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the apparatus necessary for this
kind of science is so costly as to be within the reach of few,
involving, as it does, an experience in the use of it for some
preceding generations.&nbsp; Even those who are born with the
means within their reach must take no less pains, and exercise no
less self-control, before they can attain the perfect unconscious
use of them, than would go to the making of a James Watt or a
Stephenson; it is vain, therefore, to hope that this best kind of
science can ever be put within the reach of the many;
nevertheless it may be safely said that all the other and more
generally recognised kinds of science are valueless except in so
far as they tend to minister to this the highest kind.&nbsp; They
have no <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> except so far as they
tend to do away with the necessity for work, and to diffuse good
health, and that good sense which is above
self-consciousness.&nbsp; They are to be encouraged because they
have rendered the most fortunate kind of modern European
possible, and because they tend to make possible a still more
fortunate kind than any now existing.&nbsp; But the man who
devotes himself to science cannot&mdash;with the rarest, if any,
exceptions&mdash;belong to this most fortunate class
himself.&nbsp; He occupies a lower place, both scientifically and
morally, for it is not possible but that his drudgery should
somewhat soil him both in mind and health of body, or, if this be
denied, surely it must let him and hinder him in running the race
for unconsciousness.&nbsp; We do not feel that it increases the
glory of a king or great nobleman that he should excel in what is
commonly called science.&nbsp; Certainly he should not go further
than Prince Rupert&rsquo;s drops.&nbsp; Nor should he excel in
music, art, literature, or theology&mdash;all which things are
more or less parts of science.&nbsp; He should be above them all,
save in so far as he can without effort reap renown from the
labours of others.&nbsp; It is a <i>l&acirc;che</i> in him that
he should write music or books, or paint pictures at all; but if
he must do so, his work should be at best contemptible.&nbsp;
Much as we must condemn Marcus Aurelius, we condemn James I. ever
more severely.</p>
<p>It is a pity there should exist so general a confusion of
thought upon this subject, for it may be asserted without fear of
contradiction that there is hardly any form of immorality now
rife which produces more disastrous effects upon those who give
themselves up to it, and upon society in general, than the
so-called science of those who know that they know too well to be
able to know truly.&nbsp; With very clever people&mdash;the
people who know that they know&mdash;it is much as with the
members of the early Corinthian Church, to whom St. Paul wrote,
that if they looked their numbers over, they would not find many
wise, nor powerful, nor well-born people among them.&nbsp;
Dog-fanciers tell us that performing dogs never carry their
tails; such dogs have eaten of the tree of knowledge, and are
convinced of sin accordingly&mdash;they know that they know
things, in respect of which, therefore, they are no longer under
grace, but under the law, and they have yet so much grace left as
to be ashamed.&nbsp; So with the human clever dog; he may speak
with the tongues of men and angels, but so long as he knows that
he knows, his tail will droop.&nbsp; More especially does this
hold in the case of those who are born to wealth and of old
family.&nbsp; We must all feel that a rich young nobleman with a
taste for science and principles is rarely a pleasant
object.&nbsp; We do not even like the rich young man in the Bible
who wanted to inherit eternal life, unless, indeed, he merely
wanted to know whether there was not some way by which he could
avoid dying, and even so he is hardly worth considering.&nbsp;
Principles are like logic, which never yet made a good reasoner
of a bad one, but might still be occasionally useful if they did
not invariably contradict each other whenever there is any
temptation to appeal to them.&nbsp; They are like fire, good
servants but bad masters.&nbsp; As many people or more have been
wrecked on principle as from want of principle.&nbsp; They are,
as their name implies, of an elementary character, suitable for
beginners only, and he who has so little mastered them as to have
occasion to refer to them consciously, is out of place in the
society of well-educated people.&nbsp; The truly scientific
invariably hate him, and, for the most part, the more profoundly
in proportion to the unconsciousness with which they do so.</p>
<p>If the reader hesitates, let him go down into the streets and
look in the shop-windows at the photographs of eminent men,
whether literary, artistic, or scientific, and note the work
which the consciousness of knowledge has wrought on nine out of
every ten of them; then let him go to the masterpieces of Greek
and Italian art, the truest preachers of the truest gospel of
grace; let him look at the Venus of Milo, the Discobolus, the St.
George of Donatello.&nbsp; If it had pleased these people to wish
to study, there was no lack of brains to do it with; but imagine
&ldquo;what a deal of scorn&rdquo; would &ldquo;look
beautiful&rdquo; upon the Venus of Milo&rsquo;s face if it were
suggested to her that she should learn to read.&nbsp; Which,
think you, knows most, the Theseus, or any modern professor taken
at random?&nbsp; True, the advancement of learning must have had
a great share in the advancement of beauty, inasmuch as beauty is
but knowledge perfected and incarnate&mdash;but with the pioneers
it is <i>sic vos non vobis</i>; the grace is not for them, but
for those who come after.&nbsp; Science is like offences.&nbsp;
It must needs come, but woe unto that man through whom it comes;
for there cannot be much beauty where there is consciousness of
knowledge, and while knowledge is still new it must in the nature
of things involve much consciousness.</p>
<p>It is not knowledge, then, that is incompatible with beauty;
there cannot be too much knowledge, but it must have passed
through many people who it is to be feared must be more or less
disagreeable, before beauty or grace will have anything to say to
it; it must be so incarnate in a man&rsquo;s whole being that he
shall not be aware of it, or it will fit him constrainedly as one
under the law, and not as one under grace.</p>
<p>And grace is best, for where grace is, love is not
distant.&nbsp; Grace! the old Pagan ideal whose charm even
unlovely Paul could not understand, but, as the legend tells us,
his soul fainted within him, his heart misgave him, and, standing
alone on the seashore at dusk, he &ldquo;troubled deaf heaven
with his bootless cries,&rdquo; his thin voice pleading for grace
after the flesh.</p>
<p>The waves came in one after another, the sea-gulls cried
together after their kind, the wind rustled among the dried canes
upon the sandbanks, and there came a voice from heaven saying,
&ldquo;Let My grace be sufficient for thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereon,
failing of the thing itself, he stole the word and strove to
crush its meaning to the measure of his own limitations.&nbsp;
But the true grace, with her groves and high places, and troups
of young men and maidens crowned with flowers, and singing of
love and youth and wine&mdash;the true grace he drove out into
the wilderness&mdash;high up, it may be, into Piora, and into
such-like places.&nbsp; Happy they who harboured her in her ill
report.</p>
<p>It is common to hear men wonder what new faith will be adopted
by mankind if disbelief in the Christian religion should become
general.&nbsp; They seem to expect that some new theological or
quasi-theological system will arise, which, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, shall be Christianity over again.&nbsp; It is a
frequent reproach against those who maintain that the
supernatural element of Christianity is without foundation, that
they bring forward no such system of their own.&nbsp; They pull
down but cannot build.&nbsp; We sometimes hear even those who
have come to the same conclusions as the destroyers say, that
having nothing new to set up, they will not attack the old.&nbsp;
But how can people set up a new superstition, knowing it to be a
superstition?&nbsp; Without faith in their own platform, a faith
as intense as that manifested by the early Christians, how can
they preach?&nbsp; A new superstition will come, but it is in the
very essence of things that its apostles should have no suspicion
of its real nature; that they should no more recognise the common
element between the new and the old than the early Christians
recognised it between their faith and Paganism.&nbsp; If they
did, they would be paralysed.&nbsp; Others say that the new
fabric may be seen rising on every side, and that the coming
religion is science.&nbsp; Certainly its apostles preach it
without misgiving, but it is not on that account less possible
that it may prove only to be the coming superstition&mdash;like
Christianity, true to its true votaries, and, like Christianity,
false to those who follow it introspectively.</p>
<p>It may well be we shall find we have escaped from one set of
taskmasters to fall into the hands of others far more
ruthless.&nbsp; The tyranny of the Church is light in comparison
with that which future generations may have to undergo at the
hands of the doctrinaires.&nbsp; The Church did uphold a grace of
some sort as the <i>summum bonum</i>, in comparison with which
all so-called earthly knowledge&mdash;knowledge, that is to say,
which had not passed through so many people as to have become
living and incarnate&mdash;was unimportant.&nbsp; Do what we may,
we are still drawn to the unspoken teaching of her less
introspective ages with a force which no falsehood could
command.&nbsp; Her buildings, her music, her architecture, touch
us as none other on the whole can do; when she speaks there are
many of us who think that she denies the deeper truths of her own
profounder mind, and unfortunately her tendency is now towards
more rather than less introspection.&nbsp; The more she gives way
to this&mdash;the more she becomes conscious of knowing&mdash;the
less she will know.&nbsp; But still her ideal is in grace.</p>
<p>The so-called man of science, on the other hand, seems now
generally inclined to make light of all knowledge, save of the
pioneer character.&nbsp; His ideal is in self-conscious
knowledge.&nbsp; Let us have no more Lo, here, with the
professor; he very rarely knows what he says he knows; no sooner
has he misled the world for a sufficient time with a great
flourish of trumpets than he is toppled over by one more
plausible than himself.&nbsp; He is but medicine-man, augur,
priest, in its latest development; useful it may be, but
requiring to be well watched by those who value freedom.&nbsp;
Wait till he has become more powerful, and note the vagaries
which his conceit of knowledge will indulge in.&nbsp; The Church
did not persecute while she was still weak.&nbsp; Of course every
system has had, and will have, its heroes, but, as we all very
well know, the heroism of the hero is but remotely due to system;
it is due not to arguments, nor reasoning, nor to any consciously
recognised perceptions, but to those deeper sciences which lie
far beyond the reach of self-analysis, and for the sturdy of
which there is but one schooling&mdash;to have had good
forefathers for many generations.</p>
<p>Above all things, let no unwary reader do me the injustice of
believing in <i>me</i>.&nbsp; In that I write at all I am among
the dammed.&nbsp; If he must believe in anything, let him believe
in the music of Handel, the painting of Giovanni Bellini, and in
the thirteenth chapter of St. Paul&rsquo;s First Epistle to the
Corinthians.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Whenever we find people knowing that they
know this or that, we have the same story over and over
again.&nbsp; They do not yet know it perfectly.</p>
<p>We come, therefore, to the conclusion that our knowledge and
reasoning thereupon, only become perfect, assured, unhesitating,
when they have become automatic, and are thus exercised without
further conscious effort of the mind, much in the same way as we
cannot walk nor read nor write perfectly till we can do so
automatically.</p>

43</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">APPLICATION OF FOREGOING CHAPTERS TO
CERTAIN HABITS ACQUIRED AFTER BIRTH WHICH ARE COMMONLY CONSIDERED
INSTINCTIVE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is true of knowing is also
true of willing.&nbsp; The more intensely we will, the less is
our will deliberate and capable of being recognised as will at
all.&nbsp; So that it is common to hear men declare under certain
circumstances that they had no will, but were forced into their
own action under stress of passion or temptation.&nbsp; But in
the more ordinary actions of life, we observe, as in walking or
breathing, that we do not will anything utterly and without
remnant of hesitation, till we have lost sight of the fact that
we are exercising our will.</p>
<p>The question, therefore, is forced upon us, how far this
principle extends, and whether there may not be unheeded examples
of its operation which, if we consider them, will land us in
rather unexpected conclusions.&nbsp; If it be granted that
consciousness of knowledge and of volition vanishes when the
knowledge and the volition have become intense and perfect, may
it not be possible that many actions which we do without knowing
how we do them, and without any conscious exercise of the
will&mdash;actions which we certainly could not do if we tried to
do them, nor refrain from doing if for any reason we wished to do
so&mdash;are done so easily and so unconsciously owing to excess
of knowledge or experience rather than deficiency, we having done
them too often, knowing how to do them too well, and having too
little hesitation as to the method of procedure, to be capable of
following our own action without the utter derangement of such
action altogether; or, in other cases, because we have so long
settled the question, that we have stowed away the whole
apparatus with which we work in corners of our system which we
cannot now conveniently reach?</p>
<p>It may be interesting to see whether we can find any class or
classes of actions which would seem to link actions which for
some time after birth we could not do at all, and in which our
proficiency has reached the stage of unconscious performance
obviously through repeated effort and failure, and through this
only, with actions which we could do as soon as we were born, and
concerning which it would at first sight appear absurd to say
that they can have been acquired by any process in the least
analogous to that which we commonly call experience, inasmuch as
the creature itself which does them has only just begun to exist,
and cannot, therefore, in the very nature of things, have had
experience.</p>
<p>Can we see that actions, for the acquisition of which
experience is such an obvious necessity, that whenever we see the
acquisition we assume the experience, gradate away imperceptibly
into actions which would seem, according to all reasonable
analogy, to presuppose experience, of which, however, the time
and place seem obscure, if not impossible?</p>
<p>Eating and drinking would appear to be such actions.&nbsp; The
new-born child cannot eat, and cannot drink, but he can swallow
as soon as he is born; and swallowing would appear (as we may
remark in passing) to have been an earlier faculty of animal life
than that of eating with teeth.&nbsp; The ease and
unconsciousness with which we eat and drink is clearly
attributable to practice; but a very little practice seems to go
a long way&mdash;a suspiciously small amount of practice&mdash;as
though somewhere or at some other time there must have been more
practice than we can account for.&nbsp; We can very readily stop
eating or drinking, and can follow our own action without
difficulty in either process; but, as regards swallowing, which
is the earlier habit, we have less power of self-analysis and
control: when we have once committed ourselves beyond a certain
point to swallowing, we must finish doing so,&mdash;that is to
say, our control over the operation ceases.&nbsp; Also, a still
smaller experience seems necessary for the acquisition of the
power to swallow than appeared necessary in the case of eating;
and if we get into a difficulty we choke, and are more at a loss
how to become introspective than we are about eating and
drinking.</p>
<p>Why should a baby be able to swallow&mdash;which one would
have said was the more complicated process of the two&mdash;with
so much less practice than it takes him to learn to eat?&nbsp;
How comes it that he exhibits in the case of the more difficult
operation all the phenomena which ordinarily accompany a more
complete mastery and longer practice?&nbsp; Analogy would
certainly seem to point in the direction of thinking that the
necessary experience cannot have been wanting, and that, too, not
in such a quibbling sort as when people talk about inherited
habit or the experience of the race, which, without explanation,
is to plain-speaking persons very much the same, in regard to the
individual, as no experience at all, but <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
in the child&rsquo;s own person.</p>
<p>Breathing, again, is an action acquired after birth, generally
with some little hesitation and difficulty, but still acquired in
a time seldom longer, as I am informed, than ten minutes or a
quarter of an hour.&nbsp; For an ant which has to be acquired at
all, there would seem here, as in the case of eating, to be a
disproportion between, on the one hand, the intricacy of the
process performed, and on the other, the shortness of the time
taken to acquire the practice, and the ease and unconsciousness
with which its exercise is continued from the moment of
acquisition.</p>
<p>We observe that in later life much less difficult and
intricate operations than breathing acquire much longer practice
before they can be mastered to the extent of unconscious
performance.&nbsp; We observe also that the phenomena attendant
on the learning by an infant to breathe are extremely like those
attendant upon the repetition of some performance by one who has
done it very often before, but who requires just a little
prompting to set him off, on getting which, the whole familiar
routine presents itself before him, and he repeats his task by
rote.&nbsp; Surely then we are justified in suspecting that there
must have been more <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> personal recollection
and experience, with more effort and failure on the part of the
infant itself than meet the eye.</p>
<p>It should be noticed, also, that our control over breathing is
very limited.&nbsp; We can hold our breath a little, or breathe a
little faster for a short time, but we cannot do this for long,
and after having gone without air for a certain time we must
breath.</p>
<p>Seeing and hearing require some practice before their free use
is mastered, but not very much.&nbsp; They are so far within our
control that we can see more by looking harder, and hear more by
listening attentively&mdash;but they are beyond our control in so
far as that we must see and hear the greater part of what
presents itself to us as near, and at the same time unfamiliar,
unless we turn away or shut our eyes, or stop our ears by a
mechanical process; and when we do this it is a sign that we have
already involuntarily seen or heard more than we wished.&nbsp;
The familiar, whether sight or sound, very commonly escapes
us.</p>
<p>Take again the processes of digestion, the action of the
heart, and the oxygenisation of the blood&mdash;processes of
extreme intricacy, done almost entirely unconsciously, and quite
beyond the control of our volition.</p>
<p>Is it possible that our unconsciousness concerning our own
performance of all these processes arises from
over-experience?</p>
<p>Is there anything in digestion, or the oxygenisation of the
blood, different in kind to the rapid unconscious action of a man
playing a difficult piece of music on the piano?&nbsp; There may
be in degree, but as a man who sits down to play what he well
knows, plays on, when once started, almost, as we say,
mechanically, so, having eaten his dinner, he digests it as a
matter of course, unless it has been in some way unfamiliar to
him, or he to it, owing to some derangement or occurrence with
which he is unfamiliar, and under which therefore he is at a loss
now to comport himself, as a player would be at a loss how to
play with gloves on, or with gout in his fingers, or if set to
play music upside down.</p>
<p>Can we show that all the acquired actions of childhood and
after-life, which we now do unconsciously, or without conscious
exercise of the will, are familiar acts&mdash;acts which we have
already done a very great number of times?</p>
<p>Can we also show that there are no acquired actions which we
can perform in this automatic manner, which were not at one time
difficult, requiring attention, and liable to repeated failure,
our volition failing to command obedience from the members which
should carry its purposes into execution?</p>
<p>If so, analogy will point in the direction of thinking that
other acts which we do even more unconsciously may only escape
our power of self-examination and control because they are even
more familiar&mdash;because we have done them oftener; and we may
imagine that if there were a microscope which could show us the
minutest atoms of consciousness and volition, we should find that
even the apparently most automatic actions were yet done in due
course, upon a balance of considerations, and under the
deliberate exercise of the will.</p>
<p>We should also incline to think that even such an action as
the oxygenisation of its blood by an infant of ten minutes&rsquo;
old, can only be done so well and so unconsciously, after
repeated failures on the part of the infant itself.</p>
<p>True, as has been already implied, we do not immediately see
when the baby could have made the necessary mistakes and acquired
that infinite practice without which it could never go through
such complex processes satisfactorily; we have therefore invented
the words &ldquo;hereditary instinct,&rdquo; and consider them as
accounting for the phenomenon; but a very little reflection will
show that though these words may be a very good way of stating
the difficulty, they do little or nothing towards removing
it.</p>
<p>Why should hereditary instinct enable a creature to dispense
with the experience which we see to be necessary in all other
cases before difficult operations can be performed
successfully?</p>
<p>What is this talk that is made about the experience <i>of the
race</i>, as though the experience of one man could profit
another who knows nothing about him?&nbsp; If a man eats his
dinner, it nourishes <i>him</i> and not his neighbour; if he
learns a different art, it is <i>he</i> that can do it and not
his neighbour.&nbsp; Yet, practically, we see that the vicarious
experience, which seems so contrary to our common observation,
does nevertheless appear to hold good in the case of creatures
and their descendants.&nbsp; Is there, then, any way of bringing
these apparently conflicting phenomena under the operation of one
law?&nbsp; Is there any way of showing that this experience of
the race, of which so much is said without the least attempt to
show in what way it may or does become the experience of the
individual, is in sober seriousness the experience of one single
being only, repeating in a great many different ways certain
performances with which he has become exceedingly familiar?</p>
<p>It would seem that we must either suppose the conditions of
experience to differ during the earlier stages of life from those
which we observe them to become during the heyday of any
existence&mdash;and this would appear very gratuitous, tolerable
only as a suggestion because the beginnings of life are so
obscure, that in such twilight we may do pretty much whatever we
please without danger of confutation&mdash;or that we must
suppose the continuity of life and sameness between living
beings, whether plants or animals, and their descendants, to be
far closer than we have hitherto believed; so that the experience
of one person is not enjoyed by his successor, so much as that
the successor is <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> but a part of the life of
his progenitor, imbued with all his memories, profiting by all
his experiences&mdash;which are, in fact, his own&mdash;and only
unconscious of the extent of his own memories and experiences
owing to their vastness and already infinite repetitions.</p>
<p>Certainly it presents itself to us at once as a singular
coincidence&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That we are <i>most conscious of</i>, <i>and have
most control over</i>, such habits as speech, the upright
position, the arts and sciences, which are acquisitions peculiar
to the human race, always acquired after birth, and not common to
ourselves and any ancestor who had not become entirely human.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That we are <i>less conscious of</i>, <i>and have
less control over</i>, eating and drinking, swallowing,
breathing, seeing and hearing, which were acquisitions of our
prehuman ancestry, and for which we had provided ourselves with
all the necessary apparatus before we saw light, but which are
still, geologically speaking, recent, or comparatively
recent.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That we are <i>most unconscious of</i>, <i>and have
least control over</i>, our digestion and circulation, which
belonged even to our invertebrate ancestry, and which are habits,
geologically speaking, of extreme antiquity.</p>
<p>There is something too like method in this for it to be taken
as the result of mere chance&mdash;chance again being but another
illustration of Nature&rsquo;s love of a contradiction in terms;
for everything is chance, and nothing is chance.&nbsp; And you
may take it that all is chance or nothing chance, according as
you please, but you must not have half chance and half not
chance.</p>
<p>Does it not seem as though the older and more confirmed the
habit, the more unquestioning the act of volition, till, in the
case of the oldest habits, the practice of succeeding existences
has so formulated the procedure, that, on being once committed to
such and such a line beyond a certain point, the subsequent
course is so clear as to be open to no further doubt, to admit of
no alternative, till the very power of questioning is gone, and
even the consciousness of volition?&nbsp; And this too upon
matters which, in earlier stages of a man&rsquo;s existence,
admitted of passionate argument and anxious deliberation whether
to resolve them thus or thus, with heroic hazard and experiment,
which on the losing side proved to be vice, and on the winning
virtue.&nbsp; For there was passionate argument once what shape a
man&rsquo;s teeth should be, nor can the colour of his hair be
considered as ever yet settled, or likely to be settled for a
very long time.</p>
<p>It is one against legion when a creature tries to differ from
his own past selves.&nbsp; He must yield or die if he wants to
differ widely, so as to lack natural instincts, such as hunger or
thirst, or not to gratify them.&nbsp; It is more righteous in a
man that he should &ldquo;eat strange food,&rdquo; and that his
cheek should &ldquo;so much as lank not,&rdquo; than that he
should starve if the strange food be at his command.&nbsp; His
past selves are living in him at this moment with the accumulated
life of centuries.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do this, this, this, which we too
have done, and found our profit in it,&rdquo; cry the souls of
his forefathers within him.&nbsp; Faint are the far ones, coming
and going as the sound of bells wafted on to a high mountain;
loud and clear are the near ones, urgent as an alarm of
fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Withhold,&rdquo; cry some.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on
boldly,&rdquo; cry others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me, me, me, revert
hitherward, my descendant,&rdquo; shouts one as it were from some
high vantage-ground over the heads of the clamorous
multitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, but me, me, me,&rdquo; echoes
another; and our former selves fight within us and wrangle for
our possession.&nbsp; Have we not here what is commonly called an
<i>internal tumult</i>, when dead pleasures and pains tug within
us hither and thither?&nbsp; Then may the battle be decided by
what people are pleased to call our own experience.&nbsp; Our own
indeed!&nbsp; What is our own save by mere courtesy of
speech?&nbsp; A matter of fashion.&nbsp; Sanction sanctifieth and
fashion fashioneth.&nbsp; And so with death&mdash;the most
inexorable of all conventions.</p>
<p>However this may be, we may assume it as an axiom with regard
to actions acquired after birth, that we never do them
automatically save as the result of long practice, and after
having thus acquired perfect mastery over the action in
question.</p>
<p>But given the practice or experience, and the intricacy of the
process to be performed appears to matter very little.&nbsp;
There is hardly anything conceivable as being done by man, which
a certain amount of familiarity will not enable him to do, as it
were mechanically and without conscious effort.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
most complex and difficult movements,&rdquo; writes Mr Darwin,
&ldquo;can in time be performed without the least effort or
consciousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the main business of life is done
thus unconsciously or semi-unconsciously.&nbsp; For what is the
main business of life?&nbsp; We work that we may eat and digest,
rather than eat and digest that we may work; this, at any rate,
is the normal state of things: the more important business then
is that which is carried on unconsciously.&nbsp; So again the
action of the brain, which goes on prior to our realising the
idea in which it results, is not perceived by the
individual.&nbsp; So also all the deeper springs of action and
conviction.&nbsp; The residuum with which we fret and worry
ourselves is a mere matter of detail, as the higgling and
haggling of the market, which is not over the bulk of the price,
but over the last halfpenny.</p>
<p>Shall we say, then, that a baby of a day old sucks (which
involves the whole principle of the pump, and hence a profound
practical knowledge of the laws of pneumatics and hydrostatics),
digests, oxygenises its blood (millions of years before Sir
Humphry Davy discovered oxygen), sees and hears&mdash;all most
difficult and complicated operations, involving a knowledge of
the facts concerning optics and acoustics, compared with which
the discoveries of Newton sink into utter insignificance?&nbsp;
Shall we say that a baby can do all these things at once, doing
them so well and so regularly, without being even able to direct
its attention to them, and without mistake, and at the same time
not know how to do them, and never have done them before?</p>
<p>Such an assertion would be a contradiction to the whole
experience of mankind.&nbsp; Surely the <i>onus probandi</i> must
rest with him who makes it.</p>
<p>A man may make a lucky hit now and again by what is called a
fluke, but even this must be only a little in advance of his
other performances of the same kind.&nbsp; He may multiply seven
by eight by a fluke after a little study of the multiplication
table, but he will not be able to extract the cube root of 4913
by a fluke, without long training in arithmetic, any more than an
agricultural labourer would be able to operate successfully for
cataract.&nbsp; If, then, a grown man cannot perform so simple an
operation as that we will say, for cataract, unless he have been
long trained in other similar operations, and until he has done
what comes to the same thing many times over, with what show of
reason can we maintain that one who is so far less capable than a
grown man, can perform such vastly more difficult operations,
without knowing how to do them, and without ever having done them
before?&nbsp; There is no sign of &ldquo;fluke&rdquo; about the
circulation of a baby&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; There may perhaps be
some little hesitation about its earliest breathing, but this, as
a general rule, soon passes over, both breathing and circulation,
within an hour after birth, being as regular and easy as at any
time during life.&nbsp; Is it reasonable, then, to say that the
baby does these things without knowing how to do them, and
without ever having done them before, and continues to do them by
a series of lifelong flukes?</p>
<p>It would be well if those who feel inclined to hazard such an
assertion would find some other instances of intricate processes
gone through by people who know nothing about them, and never had
any practice therein.&nbsp; What <i>is</i> to know how to do a
thing?&nbsp; Surely to do it.&nbsp; What is proof that we know
how to do a thing?&nbsp; Surely the fact that we can do it.&nbsp;
A man shows that he knows how to throw the boomerang by throwing
the boomerang.&nbsp; No amount of talking or writing can get over
this; <i>ipso facto</i>, that a baby breathes and makes its blood
circulate, it knows how to do so and the fact that it does not
know its own knowledge is only proof of the perfection of that
knowledge, and of the vast number of past occasions on which it
must have been exercised already.&nbsp; As we have said already,
it is less obvious when the baby could have gained its
experience, so as to be able so readily to remember exactly what
to do; but it is more easy to suppose that the necessary
occasions cannot have been wanting, than that the power which we
observe should have been obtained without practice and
memory.</p>
<p>If we saw any self-consciousness on the baby&rsquo;s part
about its breathing or circulation, we might suspect that it had
had less experience, or profited less by its experience, than its
neighbours&mdash;exactly in the same manner as we suspect a
deficiency of any quality which we see a man inclined to
parade.&nbsp; We all become introspective when we find that we do
not know our business, and whenever we are introspective we may
generally suspect that we are on the verge of
unproficiency.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the case of sickly
children, we observe that they sometimes do become conscious of
their breathing and circulation, just as in later life we become
conscious that we have a liver or a digestion.&nbsp; In that case
there is always something wrong.&nbsp; The baby that becomes
aware of its breathing does not know how to breathe, and will
suffer for his ignorance and incapacity, exactly in the same way
as he will suffer in later life for ignorance and incapacity in
any other respect in which his peers are commonly knowing and
capable.&nbsp; In the case of inability to breath, the punishment
is corporal, breathing being a matter of fashion, so old and long
settled that nature can admit of no departure from the
established custom, and the procedure in case of failure is as
much formulated as the fashion itself in the case of the
circulation, the whole performance has become one so utterly of
rote, that the mere discovery that we could do it at all was
considered one of the highest flights of human genius.</p>
<p>It has been said a day will come when the Polar ice shall have
accumulated, till it forms vast continents many thousands of feet
above the level of the sea, all of solid ice.&nbsp; The weight of
this mass will, it is believed, cause the world to topple over on
its axis, so that the earth will be upset as an ant-heap
overturned by a ploughshare.&nbsp; In that day time icebergs will
come crunching against our proudest cities, razing them from off
the face of the earth as though they were made of rotten
blotting-paper.&nbsp; There is no respect now of Handel nor of
Shakespeare; the works of Rembrandt and Bellini fossilise at the
bottom of the sea.&nbsp; Grace, beauty, and wit, all that is
precious in music, literature, and art&mdash;all gone.&nbsp; In
the morning there was Europe.&nbsp; In the evening there are no
more populous cities nor busy hum of men, but a sea of jagged
ice, a lurid sunset, and the doom of many ages.&nbsp; Then shall
a scared remnant escape in places, and settle upon the changed
continent when the waters have subsided&mdash;a simple people,
busy hunting shellfish on the drying ocean beds, and with little
time for introspection yet they can read and write and sum, for
by that time these accomplishments will have become universal,
and will be acquired as easily as we now learn to talk; but they
do so as a matter of course, and without
self-consciousness.&nbsp; Also they make the simpler kinds of
machinery too easily to be able to follow their own
operations&mdash;the manner of their own apprenticeship being to
them as a buried city.&nbsp; May we not imagine that, after the
lapse of another ten thousand years or so, some one of them may
again become cursed with lust of introspection, and a second
Harvey may astonish the world by discovering that it can read and
write, and that steam-engines do not grow, but are made?&nbsp; It
may be safely prophesied that he will die a martyr, and be
honoured in the fourth generation.</p>

59</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">APPLICATION OF THE FOREGOING PRINCIPLES TO
ACTIONS AND HABITS ACQUIRED BEFORE BIRTH.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> if we once admit the principle
that consciousness and volition have a tendency to vanish as soon
as practice has rendered any habit exceedingly familiar, so that
the mere presence of an elaborate but unconscious performance
shall carry with it a presumption of infinite practice, we shall
find it impossible to draw the line at those actions which we see
acquired after birth, no matter at how early a period.&nbsp; The
whole history and development of the embryo in all its stages
forces itself on our consideration.&nbsp; Birth has been made too
much of.&nbsp; It is a salient feature in the history of the
individual, but not more salient than a hundred others, and far
less so than the commencement of his existence as a single cell
uniting in itself elements derived from both parents, or perhaps
than any point in his whole existence as an embryo.&nbsp; For
many years after we are born we are still very incomplete.&nbsp;
We cease to oxygenise our blood vicariously as soon as we are
born, but we still derive our sustenance from our mothers.&nbsp;
Birth is but the beginning of doubt, the first hankering after
scepticism, the dreaming of a dawn of trouble, the end of
certainty and of settled convictions.&nbsp; Not but what before
birth there have been unsettled convictions (more&rsquo;s the
pity) with not a few, and after birth we have still so made up
our minds upon many points as to have no further need of
reflection concerning them; nevertheless, in the main, birth is
the end of that time when we really knew our business, and the
beginning of the days wherein we know not what we would do, or
do.&nbsp; It is therefore the beginning of consciousness, and
infancy is as the dosing of one who turns in his bed on waking,
and takes another short sleep before he rises.&nbsp; When we were
yet unborn, our thoughts kept the roadway decently enough; then
were we blessed; we thought as every man thinks, and held the
same opinions as our fathers and mothers had done upon nearly
every subject.&nbsp; Life was not an art&mdash;and a very
difficult art&mdash;much too difficult to be acquired in a
lifetime; it was a science of which we were consummate
masters.</p>
<p>In this sense, then, birth may indeed be looked upon as the
most salient feature in a man&rsquo;s life; but this is not at
all the sense in which it is commonly so regarded.&nbsp; It is
commonly considered as the point at which we begin to live.&nbsp;
More truly it is the point at which we leave off knowing how to
live.</p>
<p>A chicken, for example, is never so full of consciousness,
activity, reasoning faculty, and volition, as when it is an
embryo in the eggshell, making bones, and flesh, and feathers,
and eyes, and claws, with nothing but a little warmth and white
of egg to make them from.&nbsp; This is indeed to make bricks
with but a small modicum of straw.&nbsp; There is no man in the
whole world who knows consciously and articulately as much as a
half-hatched hen&rsquo;s egg knows unconsciously.&nbsp; Surely
the egg in its own way must know quite as much as the chicken
does.&nbsp; We say of the chicken that it knows how to run about
as soon as it is hatched.&nbsp; So it does; but had it no
knowledge before it was hatched?&nbsp; What made it lay the
foundations of those limbs which should enable it to run
about?&nbsp; What made it grow a horny tip to its bill before it
was hatched, so that it might peck all round the larger end of
the eggshell and make a hole for itself to get out at?&nbsp;
Having once got outside the eggshell, the chicken throws away
this horny tip; but is it reasonable to suppose that it would
have grown it at all unless it had known that it would want
something with which to break the eggshell?&nbsp; And again, is
it in the least agreeable to our experience that such elaborate
machinery should be made without endeavour, failure,
perseverance, intelligent contrivance, experience, and
practice?</p>
<p>In the presence of such considerations, it seems impossible to
refrain from thinking that there must be a closer continuity of
identity, life, and memory, between successive generations than
we generally imagine.&nbsp; To shear the thread of life, and
hence of memory, between one generation and its successor, is so
to speak, a brutal measure, an act of intellectual butchery, and
like all such strong high-handed measures, a sign of weakness in
him who is capable of it till all other remedies have been
exhausted.&nbsp; It is mere horse science, akin to the theories
of the convulsionists in the geological kingdom, and of the
believers in the supernatural origin of the species of plants and
animals.&nbsp; Yet it is to be feared that we have not a few
among us who would feel shocked rather at the attempt towards a
milder treatment of the facts before them, than at a continuance
of the present crass tyranny with which we try to crush them
inside our preconceived opinions.&nbsp; It is quite common to
hear men of education maintain that not even when it was on the
point of being hatched, had the chicken sense enough to know that
it wanted to get outside the eggshell.&nbsp; It did indeed peck
all round the end of the shell, which, if it wanted to get out,
would certainly be the easiest way of effecting its purpose; but
it did not, they say, peck because it was aware of this, but
&ldquo;promiscuously.&rdquo;&nbsp; Curious, such a uniformity of
promiscuous action among so many eggs for so many
generations.&nbsp; If we see a man knock a hole in a wall on
finding that he cannot get out of a place by any other means, and
if we see him knock this hole in a very workmanlike way, with an
implement with which he has been at great pains to make for a
long the past, but which he throws away as soon as he has no
longer use for it, thus showing that he had made it expressly for
the purpose of escape, do we say that this person made the
implement and broke the wall of his prison promiscuously?&nbsp;
No jury would acquit a burglar on these grounds.&nbsp; Then why,
without much more evidence to the contrary than we have, or can
hope to have, should we not suppose that with chickens, as with
men, signs of contrivance are indeed signs of contrivance,
however quick, subtle, and untraceable, the contrivance may
be?&nbsp; Again, I have heard people argue that though the
chicken, when nearly hatched, had such a glimmering of sense that
it pecked the shell because it wanted to get out, yet that it is
not conceivable that, so long before it was hatched, it should
have had the sense to grow the horny tip to its bill for use when
wanted.&nbsp; This, at any rate, they say, it must have grown, as
the persons previously referred to would maintain,
promiscuously.</p>
<p>Now no one indeed supposes that the chicken does what it does,
with the same self-consciousness with which a tailor makes a suit
of clothes.&nbsp; Not any one who has thought upon the subject is
likely to do it so great an injustice.&nbsp; The probability is
that it knows what it is about to an extent greater than any
tailor ever did or will, for, to say the least of it, many
thousands of years to come.&nbsp; It works with such absolute
certainty and so vast an experience, that it is utterly incapable
of following the operations of its own mind&mdash;as accountants
have been known to add up long columns of pounds, shillings, and
pence, running the three fingers of one hand, a finger for each
column, up the page, and putting the result down correctly at the
bottom, apparently without an effort.&nbsp; In the case of the
accountant, we say that the processes which his mind goes through
are so rapid and subtle as to elude his own power of observation
as well as ours.&nbsp; We do not deny that his mind goes though
processes of some kind; we very readily admit that it must do so,
and say that these processes are so rapid and subtle, owing, as a
general rule, to long experience in addition.&nbsp; Why then
should we find it so difficult to conceive that this principle,
which we observe to play so large a part in mental physiology,
wherever we can observe mental physiology at all, may have a
share also in the performance of intricate operations otherwise
inexplicable, though the creature performing them is not man, or
man only in embryo?</p>
<p>Again, after the chicken is hatched, it grows more feathers
and bones and blood, but we still say that it knows nothing about
all this.&nbsp; What then do we say it <i>does</i> know?&nbsp;
One is almost ashamed to confess that we only credit it with
knowing what it appears to know by processes which we find it
exceedingly easy to follow, or perhaps rather, which we find it
absolutely impossible to avoid following, as recognising too
great a family likeness between them, and those which are most
easily followed in our own minds, to be able to sit down in
comfort under a denial of the resemblance.&nbsp; Thus, for
example, if we see a chicken running away from a fox, we do admit
that the chicken knows the fox would kill it if it caught it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we allow that the half-hatched chicken
grew the horny tip to be ready for use, with an intensity of
unconscious contrivance which can be only attributed to
experience, we are driven to admit that from the first moment the
men began to sit upon it&mdash;and earlier too than
this&mdash;the egg was always full of consciousness and volition,
and that during its embryological condition the unhatched chicken
is doing exactly what it continues doing from the moment it is
hatched till it dies; that is to say, attempting to better
itself, doing (as Aristotle says all creatures do all things upon
all occasions) what it considers most for its advantage under the
existing circumstances.&nbsp; What it may think most advantageous
will depend, while it is in the eggshell, upon exactly the same
causes as will influence its opinions in later life&mdash;to wit,
upon its habits, its past circumstances and ways of thinking; for
there is nothing, as Shakespeare tells us, good or ill, but
thinking makes it so.</p>
<p>The egg thinks feathers much more to its advantage than hair
or fur, and much more easily made.&nbsp; If it could speak, it
would probably tell us that we could make them ourselves very
easily after a few lessons, if we took the trouble to try, but
that hair was another matter, which it really could not see how
any protoplasm could be got to make.&nbsp; Indeed, during the
more intense and active part of our existence, in the earliest
stages, that is to say, of our embryological life, we could
probably have turned our protoplasm into feathers instead of hair
if we had cared about doing so.&nbsp; If the chicken can make
feathers, there seems no sufficient reason for thinking that we
cannot do so, beyond the fact that we prefer hair, and have
preferred it for so many ages that we have lost the art along
with the desire of making feathers, if indeed any of our
ancestors ever possessed it.&nbsp; The stuff with which we make
hair is practically the same as that with which chickens make
feathers.&nbsp; It is nothing but protoplasm, and protoplasm is
like certain prophecies, out of which anything can be made by the
creature which wants to make it.&nbsp; Everything depends upon
whether a creature knows its own mind sufficiently well, and has
enough faith in its own powers of achievement.&nbsp; When these
two requisites are wanting, the strongest giant cannot lift a
two-ounce weight; when they are given, a bullock can take an
eyelash out of its eye with its hind-foot, or a minute jelly
speck can build itself a house out of various materials which it
will select according to its purpose with the nicest care, though
it have neither brain to think with, nor eyes to see with, nor
hands nor feet to work with, nor is it anything but a minute
speck of jelly&mdash;faith and protoplasm only.</p>
<p>That this is indeed so, the following passage from Dr.
Carpenter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mental Physiology&rdquo; may serve to
show:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The simplest type of an animal consists of a minute
mass of &lsquo;protoplasm,&rsquo; or living jelly, which is not
yet <i>differentiated</i> into &lsquo;organs;&rsquo; every part
having the same endowments, and taking an equal share in every
action which the creature performs.&nbsp; One of these
&lsquo;jelly specks,&rsquo; the am&oelig;ba, moves itself about
by changing the form of its body, extemporising a foot (or
pseudopodium), first in one direction, and then in another; and
then, when it has met with a nutritive particle, extemporises a
stomach for its reception, by wrapping its soft body around
it.&nbsp; Another, instead of going about in search of food,
remains in one place, but projects its protoplasmic substance
into long pseudopodia, which entrap and draw in very minute
particles, or absorb nutrient material from the liquid through
which they extend themselves, and are continually becoming fused
(as it were) into the central body, which is itself continually
giving off new pseudopodia.&nbsp; Now we can scarcely conceive
that a creature of such simplicity should possess any distinct
<i>consciousness</i> of its needs&rdquo; (why not?), &ldquo;or
that its actions should be directed by any <i>intention</i> of
its own; and yet the writer has lately found results of the most
singular elaborateness to be wrought out by the instrumentality
of these minute jelly specks, which build up tests or casings of
the most regular geometrical symmetry of form, and of the most
artificial construction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this Dr. Carpenter remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;Suppose a human
mason to be put down by the side of a pile of stones of various
shapes and sizes, and to be told to build a dome of these, smooth
on both surfaces, without using more than the least possible
quantity of a very tenacious, but very costly, cement, in holding
the stones together.&nbsp; If he accomplished this well, he would
receive credit for great intelligence and skill.&nbsp; Yet this
is exactly what these little &lsquo;jelly specks&rsquo; do on a
most minute scale; the &lsquo;tests&rsquo; they construct, when
highly magnified, bearing comparison with the most skilful
masonry of man.&nbsp; From <i>the same sandy bottom</i> one
species picks up the <i>coarser</i> quartz grains, cements them
together with <i>phosphate of iron</i> secreted from its own
substance&rdquo; (should not this rather be, &ldquo;which it has
contrived in some way or other to manufacture&rdquo;?) and thus
constructs a flask-shaped &lsquo;test,&rsquo; having a short neck
and a large single orifice.&nbsp; Another picks up the
<i>finest</i> grains, and puts them together, with the same
cement, into perfectly spherical &lsquo;tests&rsquo; of the most
extraordinary finish, perforated with numerous small pores
disposed at pretty regular intervals.&nbsp; Another selects the
<i>minutest</i> sand grains and the terminal portions of sponge
spicules, and works them up together&mdash;apparently with no
cement at all, by the mere laying of the spicules&mdash;into
perfect white spheres, like hom&oelig;opathic globules, each
having a single-fissured orifice.&nbsp; And another, which makes
a straight, many-chambered &lsquo;test,&rsquo; that resembles in
form the chambered shell of an orthoceratite&mdash;the conical
mouth of each chamber projecting into the cavity of the
next&mdash;while forming the walls of its chambers of ordinary
sand grains rather loosely held together, shapes the conical
mouth of the successive chambers by firmly cementing together
grains of ferruginous quartz, which it must have picked out from
the general mass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give these actions,&rdquo; continues Dr. Carpenter,
&ldquo;the vague designation of &lsquo;instinctive&rsquo; does
not in the least help us to account for them, since what we want
is to discover the <i>mechanism</i> by which they are worked out;
and it is most difficult to conceive how so artificial a
selection can be made by a creature so simple&rdquo; (Mental
Physiology, 4th ed. pp. 41&ndash;43)</p>
<p>This is what protoplasm can do when it has the talisman of
faith&mdash;of faith which worketh all wonders, either in the
heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under
the earth.&nbsp; Truly if a man have faith, even as a grain of
mustard seed, though he may not be able to remove mountains, he
will at any rate be able to do what is no less
difficult&mdash;make a mustard plant.</p>
<p>Yet this is but a barren kind of comfort, for we have not, and
in the nature of things cannot have, sufficient faith in the
unfamiliar, inasmuch as the very essence of faith involves the
notion of familiarity, which can grow but slowly, from experience
to confidence, and can make no sudden leap at any time.&nbsp;
Such faith cannot be founded upon reason,&mdash;that is to say,
upon a recognised perception on the part of the person holding it
that he is holding it, and of the reasons for his doing
so&mdash;or it will shift as other reasons come to disturb
it.&nbsp; A house built upon reason is a house built upon the
sand.&nbsp; It must be built upon the current cant and practice
of one&rsquo;s peers, for this is the rock which, though not
immovable, is still most hard to move.</p>
<p>But however this may be, we observe broadly that the intensity
of the will to make this or that, and of the confidence that one
can make it, depends upon the length of time during which the
maker&rsquo;s forefathers have wanted the same thing before it;
the older the custom the more inveterate the habit, and, with the
exception, perhaps, that the reproductive system is generally the
crowning act of development&mdash;an exception which I will
hereafter explain&mdash;the earlier its manifestation, until, for
some reason or another, we relinquish it and take to another,
which we must, as a general rule, again adhere to for a vast
number of generations, before it will permanently supplant the
older habit.&nbsp; In our own case, the habit of breathing like a
fish through gills may serve as an example.&nbsp; We have now
left off this habit, yet we did it formerly for so many
generations that we still do it a little; it still crosses our
embryological existence like a faint memory or dream, for not
easily is an inveterate habit broken.&nbsp; On the other
hand&mdash;again speaking broadly&mdash;the more recent the habit
the later the fashion of its organ, as with the teeth, speech,
and the higher intellectual powers, which are too new for
development before we are actually born.</p>
<p>But to return for a short time to Dr. Carpenter.&nbsp; Dr.
Carpenter evidently feels, what must indeed be felt by every
candid mind, that there is no sufficient reason for supposing
that these little specks of jelly, without brain or eyes, or
stomach, or hands, or feet, but the very lowest known form of
animal life, are not imbued with a consciousness of their needs,
and the reasoning faculties which shall enable them to gratify
those needs in a manner, all things considered, equalling the
highest flights of the ingenuity of the highest
animal&mdash;man.&nbsp; This is no exaggeration.&nbsp; It is
true, that in an earlier part of the passage, Dr. Carpenter has
said that we can scarcely conceive so simple a creature to
&ldquo;possess any distinct <i>consciousness</i> of its needs, or
that its actions should be directed by any intention of its
own;&rdquo; but, on the other hand, a little lower down he says,
that if a workman did what comes to the same thing as what the
am&oelig;ba does, he &ldquo;would receive credit for great
intelligence and skill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now if an am&oelig;ba can do
that, for which a workman would receive credit as for a highly
skilful and intelligent performance, the am&oelig;ba should
receive no less credit than the workman; he should also be no
less credited with skill and intelligence, which words
unquestionably involve a distinct consciousness of needs and an
action directed by an intention of its own.&nbsp; So that Dr.
Carpenter seems rather to blow hot and cold with one
breath.&nbsp; Nevertheless there can be no doubt to which side
the minds of the great majority of mankind will incline upon the
evidence before them; they will say that the creature is highly
reasonable and intelligent, though they would readily admit that
long practice and familiarity may have exhausted its powers of
attention to all the stages of its own performance, just as a
practised workman in building a wall certainly does not
consciously follow all the processes which he goes through.</p>
<p>As an example, however, of the extreme dislike which
philosophers of a certain school have for making the admissions
which seem somewhat grudgingly conceded by Dr. Carpenter, we may
take the paragraph which immediately follows the ones which we
have just quoted.&nbsp; Dr. Carpenter there writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The writer has often amused himself and others, when by
the seaside, with getting a <i>terebella</i> (a marine worm that
cases its body in a sandy tube) out of its house, and then,
putting it into a saucer of water with a supply of sand and
comminuted shell, watching its appropriation of these materials
in constructing a new tube.&nbsp; The extended tentacles soon
spread themselves over the bottom of the saucer and lay hold of
whatever comes in their way, &lsquo;all being fish that comes to
their net,&rsquo; and in half an hour or thereabouts the new
house is finished, though on a very rude and artificial
type.&nbsp; Now here the organisation is far higher; the
instrumentality obviously serves the needs of the animal and
suffices for them; and we characterise the action, on account of
its uniformity and apparent <i>un</i>intelligence, as
instinctive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No comment will, one would think, be necessary to make the
reader feel that the difference between the terebella and the
am&oelig;ba is one of degree rather than kind, and that if the
action of the second is as conscious and reasonable as that, we
will say, of a bird making her nest, the action of the first
should be so also.&nbsp; It is only a question of being a little
less skilful, or more so, but skill and intelligence would seem
present in both cases.&nbsp; Moreover, it is more clever of the
terebella to have made itself the limbs with which it can work,
than of the am&oelig;ba to be able to work without the limbs; and
perhaps it is more sensible also to want a less elaborate
dwelling, provided it is sufficient for practical purposes.&nbsp;
But whether the terebella be less intelligent than the
am&oelig;ba or not, it does quite enough to establish its claim
to intelligence of a higher order; and one does not see ground
for the satisfaction which Dr. Carpenter appears to find at
having, as it were, taken the taste of the am&oelig;ba&rsquo;s
performance out of our mouth, by setting us about the less
elaborate performance of the terebella, which he thinks we can
call unintelligent and instinctive.</p>
<p>I may be mistaken in the impression I have derived from the
paragraphs I have quoted.&nbsp; I commonly say they give me the
impression that I have tried to convey to the reader,
<i>i.e.</i>, that the writer&rsquo;s assent to anything like
intelligence, or consciousness of needs, an animal low down in
the scale of life, is grudging, and that he is more comfortable
when he has got hold of onto to which he can point and say that
mere, at any rate, is an unintelligent and merely instinctive
creature.&nbsp; I have only called attention to the passage as an
example of the intellectual bias of a large number of exceedingly
able and thoughtful persons, among whom, so far as I am able to
form an opinion at all, few have greater claims to our respectful
attention than Dr. Carpenter himself.</p>
<p>For the embryo of a chicken, then, we damn exactly the same
kind of reasoning power and contrivance which we damn for the
am&oelig;ba, or for our own intelligent performances in later
life.&nbsp; We do not claim for it much, if any, perception of
its own forethought, for we know very well that it is among the
most prominent features of intellectual activity that, after a
number of repetitions, it ceases to be perceived, and that it
does not, in ordinary cases, cease to be perceived till after a
very great number of repetitions.&nbsp; The fact that the embryo
chicken makes itself always as nearly as may be in the same way,
would lead us to suppose that it would be unconscious of much of
its own action, <i>provided it were always the same chicken which
made itself over and over again</i>.&nbsp; So far we can see, it
always <i>is</i> unconscious of the greater part of its own
wonderful performance.&nbsp; Surely then we have a presumption
that <i>it is the same chicken which makes itself over and over
again</i>; for such unconsciousness is not won, so far as our
experience goes, by any other means than by frequent repetition
of the same act on the part of one and the same individual.&nbsp;
How this can be we shall perceive in subsequent chapters.&nbsp;
In the meantime, we may say that all knowledge and volition would
seem to be merely parts of the knowledge and volition of the
primordial cell (whatever this may be), which slumbers but never
dies&mdash;which has grown, and multiplied, and differentiated
itself into the compound life of the womb, and which never
becomes conscious of knowing what it has once learnt effectually,
till it is for some reason on the point of, or in danger of,
forgetting it.</p>
<p>The action, therefore, of an embryo making its way up in the
world from a simple cell to a baby, developing for itself eyes,
ears, hands, and feet while yet unborn, proves to be exactly of
one and the same kind as that of a man of fifty who goes into the
City and tells his broker to buy him so many Great Northern A
shares&mdash;that is to say, an effort of the will exercised in
due course on a balance of considerations as to the immediate
expediency, and guided by past experience; while children who do
not reach birth are but prenatal spendthrifts,
ne&rsquo;er-do-weels, inconsiderate innovators, the unfortunate
in business, either through their own fault or that of others, or
through inevitable mischances, beings who are culled out before
birth instead of after; so that even the lowest idiot, the most
contemptible in health or beauty, may yet reflect with pride that
they were <i>born</i>.&nbsp; Certainly we observe that those who
have had good fortune (mother and sole cause of virtue, and sole
virtue in itself), and have profited by their experience, and
known their business best before birth, so that they made
themselves both to be and to look well, do commonly on an average
prove to know it best in after-life: they grow their clothes best
who have grown their limbs best.&nbsp; It is rare that those who
have not remembered how to finish their own bodies fairly well
should finish anything well in later life.&nbsp; But how small is
the addition to their unconscious attainments which even the
Titans of human intellect have consciously accomplished, in
comparison with the problems solved by the meanest baby living,
nay, even by one whose birth is untimely!&nbsp; In other words,
how vast is that back knowledge over which we have gone fast
asleep, through the prosiness of perpetual repetition; and how
little in comparison, is that whose novelty keeps it still within
the scope of our conscious perception!&nbsp; What is the
discovery of the laws of gravitation as compared with the
knowledge which sleeps in every hen&rsquo;s egg upon a kitchen
shelf?</p>
<p>It is all a matter of habit and fashion.&nbsp; Thus we see
kings and councillors of the earth admired for facing death
before what they are pleased to call dishonour.&nbsp; If, on
being required to go without anything they have been accustomed
to, or to change their habits, or do what is unusual in the case
of other kings under like circumstances, then, if they but fold
their cloak decently around them, and die upon the spot of shame
at having had it even required of them to do thus or thus, then
are they kings indeed, of old race, that know their business from
generation to generation.&nbsp; Or if, we will say, a prince, on
having his dinner brought to him ill-cooked, were to feel the
indignity so keenly as that he should turn his face to the wall,
and breathe out his wounded soul in one sigh, do we not admire
him as a &ldquo;<i>real</i> prince,&rdquo; who knows the business
of princes so well that he can conceive of nothing foreign to it
in connection with himself, the bare effort to realise a state of
things other than what princes have been accustomed to being
immediately fatal to him?&nbsp; Yet is there no less than this in
the demise of every half-hatched hen&rsquo;s egg, shaken rudely
by a schoolboy, or neglected by a truant mother; for surely the
prince would not die if he knew how to do otherwise, and the
hen&rsquo;s egg only dies of being required to do something to
which it is not accustomed.</p>
<p>But the further consideration of this and other like
reflections would too long detain us.&nbsp; Suffice it that we
have established the position that all living creatures which
show any signs of intelligence, must certainly each one have
already gone through the embryonic stages an infinite number of
times, or they could no more have achieved the intricate process
of self-development unconsciously, than they could play the piano
unconsciously without any previous knowledge of the
instrument.&nbsp; It remains, therefore, to show the when and
where of their having done so, and this leads us naturally to the
subject of the following chapter&mdash;Personal Identity.</p>
<h2><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PERSONAL IDENTITY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Strange</span> difficulties have
been raised by some,&rdquo; says Bishop Butler, &ldquo;concerning
personal identity, or the sameness of living agents as implied in
the notion of our existing now and hereafter, or indeed in any
two consecutive moments.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in truth it is not easy
to see the strangeness of the difficulty, if the words either
&ldquo;personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;identity&rdquo; are used in any
strictness.</p>
<p>Personality is one of those ideas with which we are so
familiar that we have lost sight of the foundations upon which it
rests.&nbsp; We regard our personality as a simple definite
whole; as a plain, palpable, individual thing, which can be seen
going about the streets or sitting indoors at home, which lasts
us our lifetime, and about the confines of which no doubt can
exist in the minds of reasonable people.&nbsp; But in truth this
&ldquo;we,&rdquo; which looks so simple and definite, is a
nebulous and indefinable aggregation of many component parts
which war not a little among themselves, our perception of our
existence at all being perhaps due to this very clash of warfare,
as our sense of sound and light is due to the jarring of
vibrations.&nbsp; Moreover, as the component parts of our
identity change from moment to moment, our personality becomes a
thing dependent upon the present, which has no logical existence,
but lives only upon the sufferance of times past and future,
slipping out of our hands into the domain of one or other of
these two claimants the moment we try to apprehend it.&nbsp; And
not only is our personality as fleeting as the present moment,
but the parts which compose it blend some of them so
imperceptibly into, and are so inextricably linked on to, outside
things which clearly form no part of our personality, that when
we try to bring ourselves to book, and determine wherein we
consist, or to draw a line as to where we begin or end, we find
ourselves completely baffled.&nbsp; There is nothing but fusion
and confusion.</p>
<p>Putting theology on one side, and dealing only with the common
daily experience of mankind, our body is certainly part of our
personality.&nbsp; With the destruction of our bodies, our
personality, as far as we can follow it, comes to a full stop;
and with every modification of them it is correspondingly
modified.&nbsp; But what are the limits of our bodies?&nbsp; They
are composed of parts, some of them so unessential as to be
hardly included in personality at all, and to be separable from
ourselves without perceptible effect, as the hair, nails, and
daily waste of tissue.&nbsp; Again, other parts are very
important, as our hands, feet, arms, legs, &amp;c., but still are
no essential parts of our &ldquo;self&rdquo; or
&ldquo;soul,&rdquo; which continues to exist in spite of their
amputation.&nbsp; Other parts, as the brain, heart, and blood,
are so essential that they cannot be dispensed with, yet it is
impossible to say that personality consists in any one of
them.</p>
<p>Each one of these component members of our personality is
continually dying and being born again, supported in this process
by the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe;
which three things link us on, and fetter us down, to the organic
and inorganic world about us.&nbsp; For our meat and drink,
though no part of our personality before we eat and drink,
cannot, after we have done so, be separated entirely from us
without the destruction of our personality altogether, so far as
we can follow it; and who shall say at what precise moment our
food has or has not become part of ourselves?&nbsp; A famished
man eats food; after a short time his whole personality is so
palpably affected that we know the food to have entered into him
and taken, as it were, possession of him; but who can say at what
precise moment it did so?&nbsp; Thus we find that we are rooted
into outside things and melt away into them, nor can any man say
he consists absolutely in this or that, nor define himself so
certainly as to include neither more nor less than himself; many
undoubted parts of his personality being more separable from it,
and changing it less when so separated, both to his own senses
and those of other people, than other parts which are strictly
speaking no parts at all.</p>
<p>A man&rsquo;s clothes, for example, as they lie on a chair at
night are no part of him, but when he wears them they would
appear to be so, as being a kind of food which warms him and
hatches him, and the loss of which may kill him of cold.&nbsp; If
this be denied, and a man&rsquo;s clothes be considered as no
part of his self, nevertheless they, with his money, and it may
perhaps be added his religious opinions, stamp a man&rsquo;s
individuality as strongly as any natural feature could stamp
it.&nbsp; Change in style of dress, gain or loss of money, make a
man feel and appear more changed than having his chin shaved or
his nails cut.&nbsp; In fact, as soon as we leave common parlance
on one side, and try for a scientific definition of personality,
we find that there is none possible, any more than there can be a
demonstration of the fact that we exist at all&mdash;a
demonstration for which, as for that of a personal God, many have
hunted but none have found.&nbsp; The only solid foundation is,
as in the case of the earth&rsquo;s crust, pretty near the
surface of things; the deeper we try to go, the damper and darker
and altogether more uncongenial we find it.&nbsp; There is no
knowing into what quagmire of superstition we may not find
ourselves drawn, if we once cut ourselves adrift from those
superficial aspects of things, in which alone our nature permits
us to be comforted.</p>
<p>Common parlance, however, settles the difficulty readily
enough (as indeed it settles most others if they show signs of
awkwardness) by the simple process of ignoring it: we decline,
and very properly, to go into the question of where personality
begins and ends, but assume it to be known by every one, and
throw the onus of not knowing it upon the over-curious, who had
better think as their neighbours do, right or wrong, or there is
no knowing into what villainy they may not presently fall.</p>
<p>Assuming, then, that every one knows what is meant by the word
&ldquo;person&rdquo; (and such superstitious bases as this are
the foundations upon which all action, whether of man, beast, or
plant, is constructed and rendered possible; for even the corn in
the fields grows upon a superstitious basis as to its own
existence, and only turns the earth and moisture into wheat
through the conceit of its own ability to do so, without which
faith it were powerless; and the lichen only grows upon the
granite rock by first saying to itself, &ldquo;I think I can do
it;&rdquo; so that it would not be able to grow unless it thought
it could grow, and would not think it could grow unless it found
itself able to grow, and thus spends its life arguing in a most
vicious circle, basing its action upon a hypothesis, which
hypothesis is in turn based upon its action)&mdash;assuming that
we know what is meant by the word &ldquo;person,&rdquo; we say
that we are one and the same from the moment of our birth to the
moment of our death, so that whatever is done by or happens to
any one between birth and death, is said to happen to or be done
by one individual.&nbsp; This in practice is found to be
sufficient for the law courts and the purposes of daily life,
which, being full of hurry and the pressure of business, can only
tolerate compromise, or conventional rendering of intricate
phenomena.&nbsp; When facts of extreme complexity have to be
daily and hourly dealt with by people whose time is money, they
must be simplified, and treated much as a painter treats them,
drawing them in squarely, seizing the more important features,
and neglecting all that does not assert itself as too essential
to be passed over&mdash;hence the slang and cant words of every
profession, and indeed all language; for language at best is but
a kind of &ldquo;patter,&rdquo; the only way, it is true, in many
cases, of expressing our ideas to one another, but still a very
bad way, and not for one moment comparable to the unspoken speech
which we may sometimes have recourse to.&nbsp; The metaphors and
<i>fa&ccedil;ons de parler</i> to which even in the plainest
speech we are perpetually recurring (as, for example, in this
last two lines, &ldquo;plain,&rdquo; &ldquo;perpetually,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;recurring,&rdquo; are all words based on metaphor, and
hence more or less liable to mislead) often deceive us, as though
there were nothing more than what we see and say, and as though
words, instead of being, as they are, the creatures of our
convenience, had some claim to be the actual ideas themselves
concerning which we are conversing.</p>
<p>This is so well expressed in a letter I have recently received
from a friend, now in New Zealand, and certainly not intended by
him for publication, that I shall venture to quote the passage,
but should say that I do so without his knowledge or permission
which I should not be able to receive before this book must be
completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words, words, words,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;are the
stumbling-blocks in the way of truth.&nbsp; Until you think of
things as they are, and not of the words that misrepresent them,
you cannot think rightly.&nbsp; Words produce the appearance of
hard and fast lines where there are none.&nbsp; Words divide;
thus we call this a man, that an ape, that a monkey, while they
are all only differentiations of the same thing.&nbsp; To think
of a thing they must be got rid of: they are the clothes that
thoughts wear&mdash;only the clothes.&nbsp; I say this over and
over again, for there is nothing of more importance.&nbsp; Other
men&rsquo;s words will stop you at the beginning of an
investigation.&nbsp; A man may play with words all his life,
arranging them and rearranging them like dominoes.&nbsp; If I
could <i>think</i> to you without words you would understand me
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If such remarks as the above hold good at all, they do so with
the words &ldquo;personal identity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The least
reflection will show that personal identity in any sort of
strictness is an impossibility.&nbsp; The expression is one of
the many ways in which we are obliged to scamp our thoughts
through pressure of other business which pays us better.&nbsp;
For surely all reasonable people will feel that an infant an hour
before birth, when in the eye of the law he has no existence, and
could not be called a peer for another sixty minutes, though his
father were a peer, and already dead,&mdash;surely such an embryo
is more personally identical with the baby into which he develops
within an hour&rsquo;s time than the born baby is so with itself
(if the expression may be pardoned), one, twenty, or it may be
eighty years after birth.&nbsp; There is more sameness of matter;
there are fewer differences of any kind perceptible by a third
person; there is more sense of continuity on the part of the
person himself; and far more of all that goes to make up our
sense of sameness of personality between an embryo an hour before
birth and the child on being born, than there is between the
child just born and the man of twenty.&nbsp; Yet there is no
hesitation about admitting sameness of personality between these
two last.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if that hazy contradiction in terms,
&ldquo;personal identity,&rdquo; be once allowed to retreat
behind the threshold of the womb, it has eluded us once for
all.&nbsp; What is true of one hour before birth is true of two,
and so on till we get back to the impregnate ovum, which may
fairly claim to have been personally identical with the man of
eighty into which it ultimately developed, in spite of the fact
that there is no particle of same matter nor sense of continuity
between them, nor recognised community of instinct, nor indeed of
anything which goes to the making up of that which we call
identity.</p>
<p>There is far more of all these things common to the impregnate
ovum and the ovum immediately before impregnation, or again
between the impregnate ovum, and both the ovum before
impregnation and the spermatozoon which impregnated it.&nbsp;
Nor, if we admit personal identity between the ovum and the
octogenarian, is there any sufficient reason why we should not
admit it between the impregnate ovum and the two factors of which
it is composed, which two factors are but offshoots from two
distinct personalities, of which they are as much part as the
apple is of the apple-tree; so that an impregnate ovum cannot
without a violation of first principles be debarred from claiming
personal identity with both its parents, and hence, by an easy
chain of reasoning, <i>with each of the impregnate ova from which
its parents were developed</i>.</p>
<p>So that each ovum when impregnate should be considered not as
descended from its ancestors, but as being a continuation of the
personality of every ovum in the chain of its ancestry, which
every ovum <i>it actually is</i> quite as truly as the
octogenarian <i>is</i> the same identity with the ovum from which
he has been developed.</p>
<p>This process cannot stop short of the primordial cell, which
again will probably turn out to be but a brief
resting-place.&nbsp; We therefore prove each one of us to <i>be
actually</i> the primordial cell which never died nor dies, but
has differentiated itself into the life of the world, all living
beings whatever, being one with it, and members one of
another.</p>
<p>To look at the matter for a moment in another light, it will
be admitted that if the primordial cell had been killed before
leaving issue, all its possible descendants would have been
killed at one and the same time.&nbsp; It is hard to see how this
single fact does not establish at the point, as it were, of a
logical bayonet, an identity, between any creature and all others
that are descended from it.</p>
<p>In Bishop Butler&rsquo;s first dissertation on personality, we
find expressed very much the same opinions as would follow from
the above considerations, though they are mentioned by the Bishop
only to be condemned, namely, &ldquo;that personality is not a
permanent but a transient thing; that it lives and dies, begins
and ends continually; that no man can any more remain one and the
same person two moments together, than two successive moments can
be one and the same moment;&rdquo; in which case, he continues,
our present self would not be &ldquo;in reality the same with the
self of yesterday, but another like self or person coming up in
its room and mistaken for it, to which another self will succeed
to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; This view the Bishop proceeds to reduce
to absurdity by saying, &ldquo;It must be a fallacy upon
ourselves to charge our present selves with anything we did, or
to imagine our present selves interested in anything which befell
us yesterday; or that our present self will be interested in what
will befall us to-morrow.&nbsp; This, I say, must follow, for if
the self or person of to-day and that of to-morrow are not the
same, but only like persons, the person of to-day is really no
more interested in what will befall the person of to-morrow than
in what will befall any other person.&nbsp; It may be thought,
perhaps, that this is not a just representation of the opinion we
are speaking of, because those who maintain it allow that a
person is the same as far back as his remembrance reaches.&nbsp;
And indeed they do use the words <i>identity</i> and <i>same
person</i>.&nbsp; Nor will language permit these words to be laid
aside, since, if they were, there must be I know not what
ridiculous periphrasis substituted in the room of them.&nbsp; But
they cannot consistently with themselves mean that the person is
really the same.&nbsp; For it is self-evident that the
personality cannot be really the same, if, as they expressly
assert, that in which it consists is not the same.&nbsp; And as
consistently with themselves they cannot, so I think it appears
they do not mean that the person is really the same, but only
that he is so in a fictitious sense; in such a sense only as they
assert&mdash;for this they do assert&mdash;that any number of
persons whatever may be the same person.&nbsp; The bare unfolding
of this notion, and laying it thus naked and open, seems the best
confutation of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fencing, for it does not deserve the name of serious
disputation, is rendered possible by the laxness with which the
words &ldquo;identical&rdquo; and &ldquo;identity&rdquo; are
commonly used.&nbsp; Bishop Butler would not seriously deny that
personality undergoes great changes between infancy and old age,
and hence that it must undergo some change from moment to
moment.&nbsp; So universally is this recognised, that it is
common to hear it said of such and such a man that he is not at
all the person he was, or of such and such another that he is
twice the man he used to be&mdash;expressions than which none
nearer the truth can well be found.&nbsp; On the other hand,
those whom Bishop Butler is intending to confute would be the
first to admit that, though there are many changes between
infancy and old age, yet they come about in any one individual
under such circumstances as we are all agreed in considering as
the factors of personal identity rather than as hindrances
thereto&mdash;that is to say, there has been no death on the part
of the individual between any two phases of his existence, and
any one phase has had a permanent though perhaps imperceptible
effect upon all succeeding ones.&nbsp; So that no one ever
seriously argued in the manner supposed by Bishop Butler, unless
with modifications and saving clauses, to which it does not suit
his purpose to call attention.</p>
<p>Identical strictly means &ldquo;one and the same;&rdquo; and
if it were tied down to its strictest usage, it would indeed
follow very logically, as we have said already, that no such
thing as personal identity is possible, but that the case
actually is as Bishop Butler has supposed his opponents without
qualification to maintain it.&nbsp; In common use, however, the
word &ldquo;identical&rdquo; is taken to mean anything so like
another that no vital or essential differences can be perceived
between them; as in the case of two specimens of the same kind of
plant, when we say they are identical in spite of considerable
individual differences.&nbsp; So with two impressions of a print
from the same plate; so with the plate itself, which is somewhat
modified with every impression taken from it.&nbsp; In like
manner &ldquo;identity&rdquo; is not held to its strict
meaning&mdash;absolute sameness&mdash;but is predicated rightly
of a past and present which are now very widely asunder, provided
they have been continuously connected by links so small as not to
give too sudden a sense of change at any one point; as, for
instance, in the case of the Thames at Oxford and Windsor or
again at Greenwich, we say the same river flows by all three
places, by which we mean that much of the water at Greenwich has
come down from Oxford and Windsor in a continuous stream.&nbsp;
How sudden a change at any one point, or how great a difference
between the two extremes is sufficient to bar identity, is one of
the most uncertain things imaginable, and seems to be decided on
different grounds in different cases, sometimes very
intelligibly, and again at others arbitrarily and
capriciously.</p>
<p>Personal identity is barred at one end, in the common opinion,
by birth, and at the other by death.&nbsp; Before birth, a child
cannot complain either by himself or another, in such way as to
set the law in motion; after death he is in like manner powerless
to make himself felt by society, except in so far as he can do so
by acts done before the breath has left his body.&nbsp; At any
point between birth and death he is liable, either by himself or
another, to affect his fellow-creatures; hence, no two other
epochs can be found of equal convenience for social purposes, and
therefore they have been seized by society as settling the whole
question of when personal identity begins and ends&mdash;society
being rightly concerned with its own practical convenience,
rather than with the abstract truth concerning its individual
members.&nbsp; No one who is capable of reflection will deny that
the limitation of personality is certainly arbitrary to a degree
as regards birth, nor yet that it is very possibly arbitrary as
regards death; and as for intermediate points, no doubt it would
be more strictly accurate to say, &ldquo;you are the now phase of
the person I met last night,&rdquo; or &ldquo;you are the being
which has been evolved from the being I met last night,&rdquo;
than &ldquo;you are the person I met last night.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
life is too short for the pen-phrases which would crowd upon us
from every quarter, if we did not set our face against all that
is under the surface of things, unless, that is to say, the going
beneath the surface is, for some special chance of profit,
excusable or capable of extenuation.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PERSONAL
IDENTITY</span>&mdash;(<i>continued</i>).</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">How</span> arbitrary current notions
concerning identity really are, may perhaps be perceived by
reflecting upon some of the many different phases of
reproduction.</p>
<p>Direct reproduction in which a creation reproduces another,
the <i>facsimile</i>, or nearly so, of itself may perhaps occur
among the lowest forms of animal life; but it is certainly not
the rule among beings of a higher order.</p>
<p>A hen lays an egg, which egg becomes a chicken, which chicken,
in the course of time, becomes a hen.</p>
<p>A moth lays an egg, which egg becomes a caterpillar, which
caterpillar, after going through several stages, becomes a
chrysalis, which chrysalis becomes a moth.</p>
<p>A medusa begets a ciliated larva, the larva begets a polyp,
the polyp begets a strobila, and the strobila begets a medusa
again; the cycle of reproduction being completed in the fourth
generation.</p>
<p>A frog lays an egg, which egg becomes a tadpole; the tadpole,
after more or fewer intermediate stages, becomes a frog.</p>
<p>The mammals lay eggs, which they hatch inside their own
bodies, instead of outside them; but the difference is one of
degree and not of kind.&nbsp; In all these cases how difficult is
it to say where identity begins or ends, or again where death
begins or ends, or where reproduction begins or ends.</p>
<p>How small and unimportant is the difference between the
changes which a caterpillar undergoes before becoming a moth, and
those of a strobila before becoming a medusa.&nbsp; Yet in the
one case we say the caterpillar does not die, but is changed
(though, if the various changes in its existence be produced
metagenetically, as is the case with many insects, it would
appear to make a clean sweep of every organ of its existence, and
start <i>de novo</i>, growing a head where its feet were, and so
on&mdash;at least twice between its lives as caterpillar and
butterfly); in this case, however, we say the caterpillar does
not die, but is changed; being, nevertheless, one personality
with the moth, into which it is developed.&nbsp; But in the case
of the strobila we say that it is not changed, but dies, and is
no part of the personality of the medusa.</p>
<p>We say the egg becomes the caterpillar, not by the death of
the egg and birth of the caterpillar, but by the ordinary process
of nutrition and waste&mdash;waste and repair&mdash;waste and
repair continually.&nbsp; In like manner we say the caterpillar
becomes the chrysalis, and the chrysalis the moth, not through
the death of either one or the other, but by the development of
the same creature, and the ordinary processes of waste and
repair.&nbsp; But the medusa after three or four cycles becomes
the medusa again, not, we say, by these same processes of
nutrition and waste, but by a series of generations, each one
involving an actual birth and an actual death.&nbsp; Why this
difference?&nbsp; Surely only because the changes in the
offspring of the medusa are marked by the leaving a little more
husk behind them, and that husk less shrivelled, than is left on
the occasion of each change between the caterpillar and the
butterfly.&nbsp; A little more residuum, which residuum, it may
be, can move about; and though shrivelling from hour to hour, may
yet leave a little more offspring before it is reduced to powder;
or again, perhaps, because in the one case, though the actors are
changed, they are changed behind the scenes, and come on in parts
and dresses, more nearly resembling those of the original actors,
than in the other.</p>
<p>When the caterpillar emerges from the egg, almost all that was
inside the egg has become caterpillar; the shell is nearly empty,
and cannot move; therefore we do not count it, and call the
caterpillar a continuation of the egg&rsquo;s existence, and
personally identical with the egg.&nbsp; So with the chrysalis
and the moth; but after the moth has laid her eggs she can still
move her wings about, and she looks nearly as large as she did
before she laid them; besides, she may yet lay a few more,
therefore we do not consider the moth&rsquo;s life as continued
in the life of her eggs, but rather in their husk, which we still
call the moth, and which we say dies in a day or two, and there
is an end of it.&nbsp; Moreover, if we hold the moth&rsquo;s life
to be continued in that of her eggs, we shall be forced to admit
her to be personally identical with each single egg, and, hence,
each egg to be identical with every other egg, as far as the
past, and community of memories, are concerned; and it is not
easy at first to break the spell which words have cast around us,
and to feel that one person may become many persons, and that
many different persons may be practically one and the same
person, as far as their past experience is concerned; and again,
that two or more persons may unite and become one person, with
the memories and experiences of both, though this has been
actually the case with every one of us.</p>
<p>Our present way of looking at these matters is perfectly right
and reasonable, so long as we bear in mind that it is a
<i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>, a sort of hieroglyphic which shall
stand for the course of nature, but nothing more.&nbsp; Repair
(as is now universally admitted by physiologists) is only a phase
of reproduction, or rather reproduction and repair are only
phases of the same power; and again, death and the ordinary daily
waste of tissue, are phases of the same thing.&nbsp; As for
identity it is determined in any true sense of the word, not by
death alone, but by a combination of death and failure of issue,
whether of mind or body.</p>
<p>To repeat.&nbsp; Wherever there is a separate centre of
thought and action, we see that it is connected with its
successive stages of being, by a series of infinitely small
changes from moment to moment, with, perhaps, at times more
startling and rapid changes, but, nevertheless, with no such
sudden, complete, and unrepaired break up of the preceding
condition, as we shall agree in calling death.&nbsp; The
branching out from it at different times of new centres of
thought and action, has commonly as little appreciable effect
upon the parent-stock as the fall of an apple full of ripe seeds
has upon an apple-tree; and though the life of the parent, from
the date of the branching off of such personalities, is more
truly continued in these than in the residuum of its own life, we
should find ourselves involved in a good deal of trouble if we
were commonly to take this view of the matter.&nbsp; The residuum
has generally the upper hand.&nbsp; He has more money, and can
eat up his new life more easily than his new life, him.&nbsp; A
moral residuum will therefore prefer to see the remainder of his
life in his own person, than in that of his descendants, and will
act accordingly.&nbsp; Hence we, in common with most other living
beings, ignore the offspring as forming part of the personality
of the parent, except in so far as that we make the father liable
for its support and for its extravagances (than which no greater
proof need be wished that the law is at heart a philosopher, and
perceives the completeness of the personal identity between
father and son) for twenty-one years from birth.&nbsp; In other
respects we are accustomed, probably rather from considerations
of practical convenience than as the result of pure reason, to
ignore the identity between parent and offspring as completely as
we ignore personality before birth.&nbsp; With these exceptions,
however, the common opinion concerning personal identity is
reasonable enough, and is found to consist neither in
consciousness of such identity, nor yet in the power of
recollecting its various phases (for it is plain that identity
survives the distinction or suspension of both these), but in the
fact that the various stages appear to the majority of people to
have been in some way or other linked together.</p>
<p>For a very little reflection will show that identity, as
commonly predicated of living agents, does not consist in
identity of matter, of which there is no same particle in the
infant, we will say, and the octogenarian into whom he has
developed.&nbsp; Nor, again, does it depend upon sameness of form
or fashion; for personality is felt to survive frequent and
radical modification of structure, as in the case of caterpillars
and other insects.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin, quoting from Professor Owen,
tells us (Plants and Animals under Domestication, vol. ii. p.
362, ed. 1875), that in the case of what is called metagenetic
development, &ldquo;the new parts are not moulded upon the inner
surfaces of the old ones.&nbsp; The plastic force has changed its
mode of operation.&nbsp; <i>The outer case</i>, <i>and all that
gave form and character to the precedent individual</i>,
<i>perish</i>, <i>and are cast off</i>; <i>they are not
changed</i> into the corresponding parts of the same
individual.&nbsp; These are due to a new and distinct
developmental process.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assuredly, there is more
birth and death in the world than is dreamt of by the greater
part of us; but it is so masked, and on the whole, so little to
our purpose, that we fail to see it.&nbsp; Yet radical and
sweeping as the changes of organism above described must be, we
do not feel them to be more a bar to personal identity than the
considerable changes which take place in the structure of our own
bodies between youth and old age.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking illustration of this is to be found
in the case of some Echinoderms, concerning which Mr. Darwin
tells us, that &ldquo;the animal in the second stage of
development is formed almost like a bud within the animal of the
first stage, the latter being then cast off like an old vestment,
yet sometimes maintaining for a short period an independent
vitality&rdquo; (&ldquo;Plants and Animals under
Domestication,&rdquo; vol. ii. p. 362, ed. 1875).</p>
<p>Nor yet does personality depend upon any consciousness or
sense of such personality on the part of the creature
itself&mdash;it is not likely that the moth remembers having been
a caterpillar, more than we ourselves remember having been
children of a day old.&nbsp; It depends simply upon the fact that
the various phases of existence have been linked together, by
links which we agree in considering sufficient to cause identity,
and that they have flowed the one out of the other in what we see
as a continuous, though it may be at times, a troubled
stream.&nbsp; This is the very essence of personality, but it
involves the probable unity of all animal and vegetable life, as
being, in reality, nothing but one single creature, of which the
component members are but, as it were, blood corpuscles or
individual cells; life being a sort of leaven, which, if once
introduced into the world, will leaven it altogether; or of fire,
which will consume all it can burn; or of air or water, which
will turn most things into themselves.&nbsp; Indeed, no
difficulty would probably be felt about admitting the continued
existence of personal identity between parents and their
offspring through all time (there being no <i>sudden</i> break at
any time between the existence of any maternal parent and that of
its offspring), were it not that after a certain time the changes
in outward appearance between descendants and ancestors become
very great, the two seeming to stand so far apart, that it seems
absurd in any way to say that they are one and the same being;
much in the same way as after a time&mdash;though exactly when no
one can say&mdash;the Thames becomes the sea.&nbsp; Moreover, the
separation of the identity is practically of far greater
importance to it than its continuance.&nbsp; We want to be
ourselves; we do not want any one else to claim part and parcel
of our identity.&nbsp; This community of identities is not found
to answer in everyday life.&nbsp; When then our love of
independence is backed up by the fact that continuity of life
between parents and offspring is a matter which depends on things
which are a good deal hidden, and that thus birth gives us an
opportunity of pretending that there has been a sudden leap into
a separate life; when also we have regard to the utter ignorance
of embryology, which prevailed till quite recently, it is not
surprising that our ordinary language should be found to have
regard to what is important and obvious, rather than to what is
not quite obvious, and is quite unimportant.</p>
<p>Personality is the creature of time and space, changing, as
time changes, imperceptibly; we are therefore driven to deal with
it as with all continuous and blending things; as with time, for
example, itself, which we divide into days, and seasons, and
times, and years, into divisions that are often arbitrary, but
coincide, on the whole, as nearly as we can make them do so, with
the more marked changes which we can observe.&nbsp; We lay hold,
in fact, of anything we can catch; the most important feature in
any existence as regards ourselves being that which we can best
lay hold of rather than that which is most essential to the
existence itself.&nbsp; We can lay hold of the continued
personality of the egg and the moth into which the egg develops,
but it is less easy to catch sight of the continued personality
between the moth and the eggs which she lays; yet the one
continuation of personality is just as true and free from quibble
as the other.&nbsp; A moth becomes each egg that she lays, and
that she does so, she will in good time show by doing, now that
she has got a fresh start, as near as may be what she did when
first she was an egg, and then a moth, before; and this I take
it, so far as I can gather from looking at life and things
generally, she would not be able to do if she had not travelled
the same road often enough already, to be able to know it in her
sleep and blindfold, that is to say, to remember it without any
conscious act of memory.</p>
<p>So also a grain of wheat is linked with an ear, containing, we
will say, a dozen grains, by a series of changes so subtle that
we cannot say at what moment the original grain became the blade,
nor when each ear of the head became possessed of an individual
centre of action.&nbsp; To say that each grain of the head is
personally identical with the original grain would perhaps be an
abuse of terms; but it can be no abuse to say that each grain is
a continuation of the personality of the original grain, and if
so, of every grain in the chain of its own ancestry; and that, as
being such a continuation, it must be stored with the memories
and experiences of its past existences, to be recollected under
the circumstances most favourable to recollection, <i>i.e.</i>,
when under similar conditions to those when the impression was
last made and last remembered.&nbsp; Truly, then, in each case
the new egg and the new grain <i>is</i> the egg, and the grain
from which its parent sprang, as completely as the full-grown ox
is the calf from which it has grown.</p>
<p>Again, in the case of some weeping trees, whose boughs spring
up into fresh trees when they have reached the ground, who shall
say at what time they cease to be members of the parent
tree?&nbsp; In the case of cuttings from plants it is easy to
elude the difficulty by making a parade of the sharp and sudden
act of separation from the parent stock, but this is only a piece
of mental sleight of hand; the cutting remains as much part of
its parent plant as though it had never been severed from it; it
goes on profiting by the experience which it had before it was
cut off, as much as though it had never been cut off at
all.&nbsp; This will be more readily seen in the case of worms
which have been cut in half.&nbsp; Let a worm be cut in half, and
the two halves will become fresh worms; which of them is the
original worm?&nbsp; Surely both.&nbsp; Perhaps no simpler case
than this could readily be found of the manner in which
personality eludes us, the moment we try to investigate its real
nature.&nbsp; There are few ideas which on first consideration
appear so simple, and none which becomes more utterly incapable
of limitation or definition as soon as it is examined
closely.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Darwin (&ldquo;Plants and Animals under
Domestication,&rdquo; vol. ii. p. 38, ed. 1875),
writes&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even with plants multiplied by bulbs, layers, &amp;c.,
which may <i>in one sense</i> be said to form part of the same
individual,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.; and again, p. 58, &ldquo;The
same rule holds good with plants when propagated by bulbs,
offsets, &amp;c., which <i>in one sense</i> still form parts of
the same individual,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; In each of these
passages it is plain that the difficulty of separating the
personality of the offspring from that of the parent plant is
present to his mind.&nbsp; Yet, p. 351 of the same volume as
above, he tells us that asexual generation &ldquo;is effected in
many ways&mdash;by the formation of buds of various kinds, and by
fissiparous generation, that is, by spontaneous or artificial
division.&rdquo;&nbsp; The multiplication of plants by bulbs and
layers clearly comes under this head, nor will any essential
difference be felt between one kind of asexual generation and
another; if, then, the offspring formed by bulbs and layers is in
one sense part of the original plant, so also, it would appear,
is all offspring developed by asexual generation in its manifold
phrases.</p>
<p>If we now turn to p. 357, we find the conclusion arrived at,
as it would appear, on the most satisfactory evidence, that
&ldquo;sexual and asexual reproduction are not seen to differ
essentially; and . . . that asexual reproduction, the power of
regrowth, and development are all parts of one and the same great
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Does it not then follow, quite reasonably and
necessarily, that all offspring, however generated, is <i>in one
sense</i> part of the individuality of its parent or
parents.&nbsp; The question, therefore, turns upon &ldquo;in what
sense&rdquo; this may be said to be the case?&nbsp; To which I
would venture to reply, &ldquo;In the same sense as the parent
plant (which is but the representative of the outside matter
which it has assimilated during growth, and of its own powers of
development) is the same individual that it was when it was
itself an offset, or a cow the same individual that it was when
it was a calf&mdash;but no otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not much difficulty will be felt about supposing the offset of
a plant, to be imbued with the memory of the past history of the
plant of which it is an offset.&nbsp; It is part of the plant
itself; and will know whatever the plant knows.&nbsp; Why, then,
should there be more difficulty in supposing the offspring of the
highest mammals, to remember in a profound but unselfconscious
way, the anterior history of the creatures of which they too have
been part and parcel?</p>
<p>Personal identity, then, is much like species itself.&nbsp; It
is now, thanks to Mr. Darwin, generally held that species blend
or have blended into one another; so that any possibility of
arrangement and apparent subdivision into definite groups, is due
to the suppression by death both of individuals and whole genera,
which, had they been now existing, would have linked all living
beings by a series of gradations so subtle that little
classification could have been attempted.&nbsp; How it is that
the one great personality of life as a whole, should have split
itself up into so many centres of thought and action, each one of
which is wholly, or at any rate nearly, unconscious of its
connection with the other members, instead of having grown up
into a huge polyp, or as it were coral reef or compound animal
over the whole world, which should be conscious but of its own
one single existence; how it is that the daily waste of this
creature should be carried on by the conscious death of its
individual members, instead of by the unconscious waste of tissue
which goes on in the bodies of each individual (if indeed the
tissue which we waste daily in our own bodies is so unconscious
of its birth and death as we suppose); how, again, that the daily
repair of this huge creature life should have become
decentralised, and be carried on by conscious reproduction on the
part of its component items, instead of by the unconscious
nutrition of the whole from a single centre, as the nutrition of
our own bodies would appear (though perhaps falsely) to be
carried on; these are matters upon which I dare not speculate
here, but on which some reflections may follow in subsequent
chapters.</p>
<h2><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OUR SUBORDINATE PERSONALITIES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen that we can apprehend
neither the beginning nor the end of our personality, which comes
up out of infinity as an island out of the sea, so gently, that
none can say when it is first visible on our mental horizon, and
fades away in the case of those who leave offspring, so
imperceptibly that none can say when it is out of sight.&nbsp;
But, like the island, whether we can see it or no, it is always
there.&nbsp; Not only are we infinite as regards time, but we are
so also as regards extension, being so linked on to the external
world that we cannot say where we either begin or end.&nbsp; If
those who so frequently declare that man is a finite creature
would point out his boundaries, it might lead to a better
understanding.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we are in the habit of considering that our
personality, or soul, no matter where it begins or ends, and no
matter what it comprises, is nevertheless a single thing,
uncompounded of other souls.&nbsp; Yet there is nothing more
certain than that this is not at all the case, but that every
individual person is a compound creature, being made up of an
infinite number of distinct centres of sensation and will, each
one of which is personal, and has a soul and individual
existence, a reproductive system, intelligence, and memory of its
own, with probably its hopes and fears, its times of scarcity and
repletion, and a strong conviction that it is itself the centre
of the universe.</p>
<p>True, no one is aware of more than one individuality in his
own person at one time.&nbsp; We are, indeed, often greatly
influenced by other people, so much so, that we act on many
occasions in accordance with their will rather than our own,
making our actions answer to their sensations, and register the
conclusions of their cerebral action and not our own; for the
time being, we become so completely part of them, that we are
ready to do things most distasteful and dangerous to us, if they
think it for their advantage that we should do so.&nbsp; Thus we
sometimes see people become mere processes of their wives or
nearest relations.&nbsp; Yet there is a something which blinds
us, so that we cannot see how completely we are possessed by the
souls which influence us upon these occasions.&nbsp; We still
think we are ourselves, and ourselves only, and are as certain as
we can be of any fact, that we are single sentient beings,
uncompounded of other sentient beings, and that our action is
determined by the sole operation of a single will.</p>
<p>But in reality, over and above this possession of our souls by
others of our own species, the will of the lower animals often
enters into our bodies and possesses them, making us do as they
will, and not as we will; as, for example, when people try to
drive pigs, or are run away with by a restive horse, or are
attacked by a savage animal which masters them.&nbsp; It is
absurd to say that a person is a single &ldquo;ego&rdquo; when he
is in the clutches of a lion.&nbsp; Even when we are alone, and
uninfluenced by other people except in so far as we remember
their wishes, we yet generally conform to the usages which the
current feeling of our peers has taught us to respect; their will
having so mastered our original nature, that, do what we may, we
can never again separate ourselves and dwell in the isolation of
our own single personality.&nbsp; And even though we succeeded in
this, and made a clean sweep of every mental influence which had
ever been brought to bear upon us, and though at the same time we
were alone in some desert where there was neither beast nor bird
to attract our attention or in any way influence our action, yet
we could not escape the parasites which abound within us; whose
action, as every medical man well knows, is often such as to
drive men to the commission of grave crimes, or to throw them
into convulsions, make lunatics of them, kill them&mdash;when but
for the existence and course of conduct pursued by these
parasites they would have done no wrong to any man.</p>
<p>These parasites&mdash;are they part of us or no?&nbsp; Some
are plainly not so in any strict sense of the word, yet their
action may, in cases which it is unnecessary to detail, affect us
so powerfully that we are irresistibly impelled to act in such or
such a manner; and yet we are as wholly unconscious of any
impulse outside of our own &ldquo;ego&rdquo; as though they were
part of ourselves; others again are essential to our very
existence, as the corpuscles of the blood, which the best
authorities concur in supposing to be composed of an infinite
number of living souls, on whose welfare the healthy condition of
our blood, and hence of our whole bodies, depends.&nbsp; We
breathe that they may breathe, not that we may do so; we only
care about oxygen in so far as the infinitely small beings which
course up and down in our veins care about it: the whole
arrangement and mechanism of our lungs may be our doing, but is
for their convenience, and they only serve us because it suits
their purpose to do so, as long as we serve them.&nbsp; Who shall
draw the line between the parasites which are part of us, and the
parasites which are not part of us?&nbsp; Or again, between the
influence of those parasites which are within us, but are yet not
<i>us</i>, and the external influence of other sentient beings
and our fellow-men?&nbsp; There is no line possible.&nbsp;
Everything melts away into everything else; there are no hard
edges; it is only from a little distance that we see the effect
as of individual features and existences.&nbsp; When we go close
up, there is nothing but a blur and confused mass of apparently
meaningless touches, as in a picture by Turner.</p>
<p>The following passage from Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s provisional
theory of Pangenesis, will sufficiently show that the above is no
strange and paradoxical view put forward wantonly, but that it
follows as a matter of course from the conclusions arrived at by
those who are acknowledged leaders in the scientific world.&nbsp;
Mr. Darwin writes thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The functional independence of the elements or units
of the body</i>.&mdash;Physiologists agree that the whole
organism consists of a multitude of elemental parts, which are to
a great extent independent of one another.&nbsp; Each organ, says
Claude Bernard, has its proper life, its autonomy; it can develop
and reproduce itself independently of the adjoining
tissues.&nbsp; A great German authority, Virchow, asserts still
more emphatically that each system consists of &lsquo;an enormous
mass of minute centres of action. . . .&nbsp; Every element has
its own special action, and even though it derive its stimulus to
activity from other parts, yet alone effects the actual
performance of duties. . . .&nbsp; Every single epithelial and
muscular fibre-cell leads a sort of parasitical existence in
relation to the rest of the body. . . .&nbsp; Every single bone
corpuscle really possesses conditions of nutrition peculiar to
itself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Each element, as Sir J. Paget remarks, lives
its appointed time, and then dies, and is replaced after being
cast off and absorbed.&nbsp; I presume that no physiologist
doubts that, for instance, each bone corpuscle of the finger
differs from the corresponding corpuscle of the corresponding
joint of the toe,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Plants
and Animals under Domestication,&rdquo; vol. ii. pp. 364, 365,
ed. 1875).</p>
<p>In a work on heredity by M. Ribot, I find him saying,
&ldquo;Some recent authors attribute a memory&rdquo; (and if so,
surely every attribute of complete individuality) &ldquo;to every
organic element of the body;&rdquo; among them Dr. Maudsley, who
is quoted by M. Ribot, as saying, &ldquo;The permanent effects of
a particular virus, such as that of the variola, in the
constitution, shows that the organic element remembers for the
remainder of its life certain modifications it has
received.&nbsp; The manner in which a cicatrix in a child&rsquo;s
finger grows with the growth of the body, proves, as has been
shown by Paget, that the organic element of the part does not
forget the impression it has received.&nbsp; What has been said
about the different nervous centres of the body demonstrates the
existence of a memory in the nerve cells diffused through the
heart and intestines; in those of the spinal cord, in the cells
of the motor ganglia, and in the cells of the cortical substance
of the cerebal hemispheres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, if words have any meaning at all, it must follow from the
passages quoted above, that each cell in the human body is a
person with an intelligent soul, of a low class, perhaps, but
still differing from our own more complex soul in degree, and not
in kind; and, like ourselves, being born, living, and
dying.&nbsp; So that each single creature, whether man or beast,
proves to be as a ray of white light, which, though single, is
compounded of the red, blue, and yellow rays.&nbsp; It would
appear, then, as though &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our
souls,&rdquo; or &ldquo;selves,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;personalities,&rdquo; or by whatever name we may prefer to
be called, are but the <i>consensus</i> and full flowing stream
of countless sensations and impulses on the part of our tributary
souls or &ldquo;selves,&rdquo; who probably know no more that we
exist, and that they exist as part of us, than a microscopic
water-flea knows the results of spectrum analysis, or than an
agricultural labourer knows the working of the British
constitution: and of whom we know no more, until some misconduct
on our part, or some confusion of ideas on theirs, has driven
them into insurrection, than we do of the habits and feelings of
some class widely separated from our own.</p>
<p>These component souls are of many and very different natures,
living in territories which are to them vast continents, and
rivers, and seas, but which are yet only the bodies of our other
component souls; coral reefs and sponge-beds within us; the
animal itself being a kind of mean proportional between its house
and its soul, and none being able to say where house ends and
animal begins, more than they can say where animal ends and soul
begins.&nbsp; For our bones within us are but inside walls and
buttresses, that is to say, houses constructed of lime and stone,
as it were, by coral insects; and our houses without us are but
outside bones, a kind of exterior skeleton or shell, so that we
perish of cold if permanently and suddenly deprived of the
coverings which warm us and cherish us, as the wing of a hen
cherishes her chickens.&nbsp; If we consider the shells of many
living creatures, we shall find it hard to say whether they are
rather houses, or part of the animal itself, being, as they are,
inseparable from the animal, without the destruction of its
personality.</p>
<p>Is it possible, then, to avoid imagining that if we have
within us so many tributary souls, so utterly different from the
soul which they unite to form, that they neither can perceive us,
nor we them, though it is in us that they live and move and have
their being, and though we are what we are, solely as the result
of their co-operation&mdash;is it possible to avoid imagining
that we may be ourselves atoms, undesignedly combining to form
some vaster being, though we are utterly incapable of perceiving
that any such being exists, or of realising the scheme or scope
of our own combination?&nbsp; And this, too, not a spiritual
being, which, without matter, or what we think matter of some
sort, is as complete nonsense to us as though men bade us love
and lean upon an intelligent vacuum, but a being with what is
virtually flesh and blood and bones; with organs, senses,
dimensions, in some way analogous to our own, into some other
part of which being, at the time of our great change we must
infallibly re-enter, starting clean anew, with bygones bygones,
and no more ache for ever from either age or antecedents.&nbsp;
Truly, sufficient for the life is the evil thereof.&nbsp; Any
speculations of ours concerning the nature of such a being, must
be as futile and little valuable as those of a blood corpuscle
might be expected to be concerning the nature of man; but if I
were myself a blood corpuscle, I should be amused at making the
discovery that I was not only enjoying life in my own sphere, but
was <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> part of an animal which would not die
with myself, and in which I might thus think of myself as
continuing to live to all eternity, or to what, as far as my
power of thought would carry me, must seem practically
eternal.&nbsp; But, after all, the amusement would be of a rather
dreary nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I were the being of whom such an
introspective blood corpuscle was a component item, I should
conceive he served me better by attending to my blood and making
himself a successful corpuscle, than by speculating about my
nature.&nbsp; He would serve me best by serving himself best,
without being over curious.&nbsp; I should expect that my blood
might suffer if his brain were to become too active.&nbsp; If,
therefore, I could discover the vein in which he was, I should
let him out to begin life anew in some other and,
<i>qu&acirc;</i> me, more profitable capacity.</p>
<p>With the units of our bodies it is as with the stars of
heaven: there is neither speech nor language, but their voices
are heard among them.&nbsp; Our will is the <i>fiat</i> of their
collective wisdom, as sanctioned in their parliament, the brain;
it is they who make us do whatever we do&mdash;it is they who
should be rewarded if they have done well, or hanged if they have
committed murder.&nbsp; When the balance of power is well
preserved among them, when they respect each other&rsquo;s rights
and work harmoniously together, then we thrive and are well; if
we are ill, it is because they are quarrelling with themselves,
or are gone on strike for this or that addition to their
environment, and our doctor must pacify or chastise them as best
he may.&nbsp; They are we and we are they; and when we die it is
but a redistribution of the balance of power among them or a
change of dynasty, the result, it may be, of heroic struggle,
with more epics and love romances than we could read from now to
the Millennium, if they were so written down that we could
comprehend them.</p>
<p>It is plain, then, that the more we examine the question of
personality the more it baffles us, the only safeguard against
utter confusion and idleness of thought being to fall back upon
the superficial and common sense view, and refuse to tolerate
discussions which seem to hold out little prospect of commercial
value, and which would compel us, if logically followed, to be at
the inconvenience of altering our opinions upon matters which we
have come to consider as settled.</p>
<p>And we observe that this is what is practically done by some
of our ablest philosophers, who seem unwilling, if one may say so
without presumption, to accept the conclusions to which their own
experiments and observations would seem to point.</p>
<p>Dr. Carpenter, for example, quotes the well-known experiments
upon headless frogs.&nbsp; If we cut off a frog&rsquo;s head and
pinch any part of its skin, the animal at once begins to move
away with the same regularity as though the brain had not been
removed.&nbsp; Flourens took guinea-pigs, deprived them of the
cerebral lobes, and then irritated their skin; the animals
immediately walked, leaped, and trotted about, but when the
irritation was discontinued they ceased to move.&nbsp; Headless
birds, under excitation, can still perform with their wings the
rhythmic movements of flying.&nbsp; But here are some facts more
curious still, and more difficult of explanation.&nbsp; If we
take a frog or a strong and healthy triton, and subject it to
various experiments; if we touch, pinch, or burn it with acetic
acid, and if then, after decapitating the animal, we subject it
to the same experiments, it will be seen that the reactions are
exactly the same; it will strive to be free of the pain, and to
shake off the acetic acid that is burning it; it will bring its
foot up to the part of its body that is irritated, and this
movement of the member will follow the irritation wherever it may
be produced.</p>
<p>The above is mainly taken from M. Ribot&rsquo;s work on
heredity rather than Dr. Carpenter&rsquo;s, because M. Ribot
tells us that the head of the frog was actually cut off, a fact
which does not appear so plainly in Dr. Carpenter&rsquo;s
allusion to the same experiments.&nbsp; But Dr. Carpenter tells
us that <i>after the brain of a frog has been
removed</i>&mdash;which would seem to be much the same thing as
though its head were cut off&mdash;&ldquo;if acetic acid be
applied over the upper and under part of the thigh, the foot of
the same side will wipe it away; <i>but if that foot be cut
off</i>, <i>after some ineffectual efforts and a short period of
inaction</i>,&rdquo; during which it is hard not to surmise that
the headless body is considering what it had better do under the
circumstances, &ldquo;<i>the same movement will be made by the
foot of the opposite side</i>,&rdquo; which, to ordinary people,
would convey the impression that the headless body was capable of
feeling the impressions it had received, and of reasoning upon
them by a psychological act; and this of course involves the
possession of a soul of some sort.</p>
<p>Here is a frog whose right thigh you burn with acetic
acid.&nbsp; Very naturally it tries to get at the place with its
right foot to remove the acid.&nbsp; You then cut off the
frog&rsquo;s head, and put more acetic acid on the some place:
the headless frog, or rather the body of the late frog, does just
what the frog did before its head was cut off&mdash;it tries to
get at the place with its right foot.&nbsp; You now cut off its
right foot: the headless body deliberates, and after a while
tries to do with its left foot what it can no longer do with its
right.&nbsp; Plain matter-of-fact people will draw their own
inference.&nbsp; They will not be seduced from the superficial
view of the matter.&nbsp; They will say that the headless body
can still, to some extent, feel, think, and act, and if so, that
it must have a living soul.</p>
<p>Dr. Carpenter writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Now the
performance of these, as well as of many other movements, that
show a most remarkable adaptation to a purpose, might be supposed
to indicate that sensations are called up by the
<i>impressions</i>, and that the animal can not only <i>feel</i>,
but can voluntarily direct its movements so as to get rid of the
irritation which annoys it.&nbsp; But such an inference would be
inconsistent with other facts.&nbsp; In the first place, the
motions performed under such circumstances are never spontaneous,
but are always excited by a stimulus of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we pause to ask ourselves whether any action of any
creature under any circumstances is ever excited without
&ldquo;stimulus of some kind,&rdquo; and unless we can answer
this question in the affirmative, it is not easy to see how Dr.
Carpenter&rsquo;s objection is valid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;a decapitated
frog&rdquo; (here then we have it that the frog&rsquo;s head was
actually cut off) &ldquo;after the first violent convulsive
moments occasioned by the operation have passed away, remains at
rest until it is touched; and then the leg, or its whole body may
be thrown into sudden action, which suddenly subsides
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; (How does this quiescence when it no longer
feels anything show that the &ldquo;leg or whole body&rdquo; had
not perceived something which made it feel when it was not
quiescent?)&mdash;&ldquo;Again we find that such movements may be
performed not only when the brain has been removed, the spinal
cord remaining entire, but also when the spinal cord has been
itself cut across, so as to be divided into two or more portions,
each of them completely isolated from each other, and from other
parts of the nervous centres.&nbsp; Thus, if the head of a frog
be cut off, and its spinal cord be divided in the middle of the
back, so that its fore legs remain connected with the upper part,
and its hind legs with the lower, each pair of members may be
excited to movements by stimulants applied to itself; but the two
pairs will not exhibit any consentaneous motions, as they will do
when the spinal cord is undivided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may be put perhaps more plainly thus.&nbsp; If you take a
frog and cut it into three pieces&mdash;say, the head for one
piece, the fore legs and shoulder for another, and the hind legs
for a third&mdash;and then irritate any one of these pieces, you
will find it move much as it would have moved under like
irritation if the animal had remained undivided, but you will no
longer find any concert between the movements of the three
pieces; that is to say, if you irritate the head, the other two
pieces will remain quiet, and if you irritate the hind legs, you
will excite no action in the fore legs or head.</p>
<p>Dr. Carpenter continues: &ldquo;Or if the spinal cord be cut
across without the removal of the brain, the lower limbs may be
<i>excited</i> to movement by an appropriate stimulant, though
the animal has clearly no power over them, whilst the upper part
remains under its control as completely as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why are the head and shoulders &ldquo;the animal&rdquo; more
than the hind legs under these circumstances?&nbsp; Neither half
can exist long without the other; the two parts, therefore, being
equally important to each other, we have surely as good a right
to claim the title of &ldquo;the animal&rdquo; for the hind legs,
and to maintain that they have no power over the head and
shoulders, as any one else has to claim the animalship for these
last.&nbsp; What we say is, that the animal has ceased to exist
as a frog on being cut in half, and that the two halves are no
longer, either of them, the frog, but are simply pieces of still
living organism, each of which has a soul of its own, being
capable of sensation, and of intelligent psychological action as
the consequence of sensations, though the one part has probably a
much higher and more intelligent soul than the other, and neither
part has a soul for a moment comparable in power and durability
to that of the original frog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it is scarcely conceivable,&rdquo; continues Dr
Carpenter, &ldquo;that in this last case sensations should be
felt and volition exercised through the instrumentality of that
portion of the spinal cord which remains connected with the
nerves of the posterior extremities, but which is cut off from
the brain.&nbsp; For if it were so, there must be two distinct
centres of sensation and will in the same animal, the attributes
of the brain not being affected; and by dividing the spinal cord
into two or more segments we might thus create in the body of one
animal two or more such independent centres in addition to that
which holds its proper place in the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the face of the facts before us, it does not seen
far-fetched to suppose that there <i>are</i> two, or indeed an
infinite number of centres of sensation and will in an animal,
the attributes of whose brain are not affected but that these
centres, while the brain is intact, habitually act in connection
with and in subordination to that central authority; as in the
ordinary state of the fish trade, fish is caught, we will say, at
Yarmouth, sent up to London, and then sent down to Yarmouth again
to be eaten, instead of being eaten at Yarmouth when
caught.&nbsp; But from the phenomena exhibited by three pieces of
an animal, it is impossible to argue that the causes of the
phenomena were present in the quondam animal itself; the memory
of an infinite series of generations having so habituated the
local centres of sensation and will, to act in concert with the
central government, that as long as they can get at that
government, they are absolutely incapable of acting
independently.&nbsp; When thrown on their own resources, they are
so demoralised by ages of dependence on the brain, that they die
after a few efforts at self-assertion, from sheer unfamiliarity
with the position, and inability to recognise themselves when
disjointed rudely from their habitual associations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Dr. Carpenter says, &ldquo;To say that two or
more distinct centres of sensation and will are present in such a
case, would really be the same as saying that we have the power
of constituting two or more distinct egos in one body, <i>which
is manifestly absurd</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One sees the absurdity of
maintaining that we can make one frog into two frogs by cutting a
frog into two pieces, but there is no absurdity in believing that
the two pieces have minor centres of sensation and intelligence
within themselves, which, when the animal is entire, act in much
concert with the brain, and with each other, that it is not easy
to detect their originally autonomous character, but which, when
deprived of their power of acting in concert, are thrown back
upon earlier habit, now too long forgotten to be capable of
permanent resumption.</p>
<p>Illustrations are apt to mislead, nevertheless they may
perhaps be sometimes tolerated.&nbsp; Suppose, for example, that
London to the extent, say, of a circle with a six-mile radius
from Charing Cross, were utterly annihilated in the space of five
minutes during the Session of Parliament.&nbsp; Suppose, also,
that two entirely impassable barriers, say of five miles in
width, half a mile high, and red hot, were thrown across England;
one from Gloucester to Harwich, and another from Liverpool to
Hull, and at the same time the sea were to become a mass of
molten lava, so no water communication should be possible; the
political, mercantile, social, and intellectual life of the
country would be convulsed in a manner which it is hardly
possible to realise.&nbsp; Hundreds of thousands would die
through the dislocation of existing arrangements.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, each of the three parts into which England was
divided would show signs of provincial life for which it would
find certain imperfect organisms ready to hand.&nbsp; Bristol,
Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester, accustomed though they are
to act in subordination to London, would probably take up the
reins of government in their several sections; they would make
their town councils into local governments, appoint judges from
the ablest of their magistrates, organise relief committees, and
endeavour as well as they could to remove any acetic acid that
might be now poured on Wiltshire, Warwickshire, or
Northumberland, but no concert between the three divisions of the
country would be any longer possible.&nbsp; Should we be
justified, under these circumstances, in calling any of the three
parts of England, England?&nbsp; Or, again, when we observed the
provincial action to be as nearly like that of the original
undivided nation as circumstances would allow, should we be
justified in saying that the action, such as it was, was not
political?&nbsp; And, lastly, should we for a moment think that
an admission that the provincial action was of a <i>bon&acirc;
fide</i> political character would involve the supposition that
England, undivided, had more than one &ldquo;ego&rdquo; as
England, no matter how many subordinate &ldquo;egos&rdquo; might
go to the making of it, each one of which proved, on emergency,
to be capable of a feeble autonomy?</p>
<p>M. Ribot would seem to take a juster view of the phenomenon
when he says (p. 222 of the English translation)&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can hardly say that here the movements are
co-ordinated like those of a machine; the acts of the animal are
adapted to a special end; we find in them the characters of
intelligence and will, a knowledge and choice of means, since
they are as variable as the cause which provokes them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If these, then, and similar acts, were such that both
the impressions which produced them and the acts themselves were
perceived by the animal, would they not be called
psychological?&nbsp; Is there not in them all that constitutes an
intelligent act&mdash;adaptation of means to ends; not a general
and vague adaptation, but a determinate adaptation to a
determinate end?&nbsp; In the reflex action we find all that
constitutes in some sort the very groundwork of an intelligent
act&mdash;that is to say, the same series of stages, in the same
order, with the same relations between them.&nbsp; We have thus,
in the reflex act, all that constitutes the psychological act
except consciousness.&nbsp; The reflex act, which is
physiological, differs in nothing from the psychological act,
save only in this&mdash;that it is without
consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only remark which suggests itself upon this, is that we
have no right to say that the part of the animal which moves does
not also perceive its own act of motion, as much as it has
perceived the impression which has caused it to move.&nbsp; It is
plain &ldquo;the animal&rdquo; cannot do so, for the animal
cannot be said to be any longer in existence.&nbsp; Half a frog
is not a frog; nevertheless, if the hind legs are capable, as M.
Ribot appears to admit, of &ldquo;perceiving the
impression&rdquo; which produces their action, and if in that
action there is (and there would certainly appear to be so)
&ldquo;all that constitutes an intelligent act, . . . a
determinate adaptation to a determinate end,&rdquo; one fails to
see on what ground they should be supposed to be incapable of
perceiving their own action, in which case the action of the hind
legs becomes distinctly psychological.</p>
<p>Secondly, M. Ribot appears to forget that it is the tendency
of all psychological action to become unconscious on being
frequently repeated, and that no line can be drawn between
psychological acts and those reflex acts which he calls
physiological.&nbsp; All we can say is, that there are acts which
we do without knowing that we do them; but the analogy of many
habits which we have been able to watch in their passage from
laborious consciousness to perfect unconsciousness, would suggest
that all action is really psychological, only that the
soul&rsquo;s action becomes invisible to ourselves after it has
been repeated sufficiently often&mdash;that there is, in fact, a
law as simple as in the case of optics or gravitation, whereby
conscious perception of any action shall vary inversely as the
square, say, of its being repeated.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand the advantage to the individual of
this power of doing things rightly without thinking about them;
for were there no such power, the attention would be incapable of
following the multitude of matters which would be continually
arresting it; those animals which had developed a power of
working automatically, and without a recurrence to first
principles when they had once mastered any particular process,
would, in the common course of events, stand a better chance of
continuing their species, and thus of transmitting their new
power to their descendants.</p>
<p>M. Ribot declines to pursue the subject further, and has only
cursorily alluded to it.&nbsp; He writes, however, that, on the
&ldquo;obscure problem&rdquo; of the difference between reflex
and psychological actions, some say, &ldquo;when there can be no
consciousness, because the brain is wanting, there is, in spite
of appearances, only mechanism,&rdquo; whilst others maintain,
that &ldquo;when there is selection, reflection, psychical
action, there must also be consciousness in spite of
appearances.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little later (p. 223), he says,
&ldquo;It is quite possible that if a headless animal could live
a sufficient length of time&rdquo; (that is to say, if <i>the
hind legs of an animal</i> could live a sufficient length of time
without the brain), &ldquo;there would be found in it&rdquo;
(<i>them</i>) &ldquo;a consciousness like that of the lower
species, which would consist merely in the faculty of
apprehending the external world.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Why merely?&nbsp;
It is more than apprehending the outside world to be able to try
to do a thing with one&rsquo;s left foot, when one finds that one
cannot do it with one&rsquo;s right.)&nbsp; &ldquo;It would not
be correct to say that the amphioxus, the only one among fishes
and vertebrata which has a spinal cord without a brain, has no
consciousness because it has no brain; and if it be admitted that
the little ganglia of the invertebrata can form a consciousness,
the same may hold good for the spinal cord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that it is within the common scope and
meaning of the words &ldquo;personal identity,&rdquo; not only
that one creature can become many as the moth becomes manifold in
her eggs, but that each individual may be manifold in the sense
of being compounded of a vast number of subordinate
individualities which have their separate lives within him, with
their hopes, and fears, and intrigues, being born and dying
within us, many generations, of them during our single
lifetime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An organic being,&rdquo; writes Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;is a
microcosm, a little universe, formed of a host of
self-propagating organisms, inconceivably minute, and numerous as
the stars in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As these myriads of smaller organisms are parts and processes
of us, so are we but parts and processes of life at large.</p>

125</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">APPLICATION OF THE FOREGOING
CHAPTERS&mdash;THE ASSIMILATION OF OUTSIDE MATTER.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us now return to the position
which we left at the end of the fourth chapter.&nbsp; We had then
concluded that the self-development of each new life in
succeeding generations&mdash;the various stages through which it
passes (as it would appear, at first sight, without rhyme or
reason)&mdash;the manner in which it prepares structures of the
most surpassing intricacy and delicacy, for which it has no use
at the time when it prepares them&mdash;and the many elaborate
instincts which it exhibits immediately on, and indeed before,
birth&mdash;all point in the direction of habit and memory, as
the only causes which could produce them.</p>
<p>Why should the embryo of any animal go through so many
stages&mdash;embryological allusions to forefathers of a widely
different type?&nbsp; And why, again, should the germs of the
same kind of creature always go through the same stages?&nbsp; If
the germ of any animal now living is, in its simplest state, but
part of the personal identity of one of the original germs of all
life whatsoever, and hence, if any now living organism must be
considered without quibble as being itself millions of years old,
and as imbued with an intense though unconscious memory of all
that it has done sufficiently often to have made a permanent
impression; if this be so, we can answer the above questions
perfectly well.&nbsp; The creature goes through so many
intermediate stages between its earliest state as life at all,
and its latest development, for the simplest of all reasons,
namely, because this is the road by which it has always hitherto
travelled to its present differentiation; this is the road it
knows, and into every turn and up or down of which, it has been
guided by the force of circumstances and the balance of
considerations.&nbsp; These, acting in such a manner for such and
such a time, caused it to travel in such and such fashion, which
fashion having been once sufficiently established, becomes a
matter of trick or routine to which the creature is still a
slave, and in which it confirms itself by repetition in each
succeeding generation.</p>
<p>Thus I suppose, as almost every one else, so far as I can
gather, supposes, that we are descended from ancestors of widely
different characters to our own.&nbsp; If we could see some of
our forefathers a million years back, we should find them unlike
anything we could call man; if we were to go back fifty million
years, we should find them, it may be, fishes pure and simple,
breathing through gills, and unable to exist for many minutes in
air.</p>
<p>It is admitted on all hands that there is more or less analogy
between the embryological development of the individual, and the
various phases or conditions of life through which his
forefathers have passed.&nbsp; I suppose, then, that the fish of
fifty million years back and the man of to-day are one single
living being, in the same sense, or very nearly so, as the
octogenarian is one single living being with the infant from
which he has grown; and that the fish has lived himself into
manhood, not as we live out our little life, living, and living,
and living till we die, but living by pulsations, so to speak;
living so far, and after a certain time going into a new body,
and throwing off the old; making his body much as we make
anything that we want, and have often made already, that is to
say, as nearly as may be in the same way as he made it last time;
also that he is as unable as we ourselves are, to make what he
wants without going through the usual processes with which he is
familiar, even though there may be other better ways of doing the
same thing, which might not be far to seek, if the creature
thought them better, and had not got so accustomed to such and
such a method, that he would only be baffled and put out by any
attempt to teach him otherwise.</p>
<p>And this oneness of personality between ourselves and our
supposed fishlike ancestors of many millions of years ago, must
hold also between each individual one of us and the single pair
of fishes from which we are each (on the present momentary
hypothesis) descended; and it must also hold between such pair of
fishes and all their descendants besides man, it may be some of
them birds, and others fishes; all these descendants, whether
human or otherwise, being but the way in which the creature
(which was a pair of fishes when we first took it in hand though
it was a hundred thousand other things as well, and had been all
manner of other things before any part of it became fishlike)
continues to exist&mdash;its manner, in fact, of growing.&nbsp;
As the manner in which the human body grows is by the continued
birth and death, in our single lifetime, of many generations of
cells which we know nothing about, but say that we have had only
one hand or foot all our lives, when we have really had many, one
after another; so this huge compound creature, <span
class="GutSmall">LIFE</span>, probably thinks itself but one
single animal whose component cells, as it may imagine, grow, and
it may be waste and repair, but do not die.</p>
<p>It may be that the cells of which we are built up, and which
we have already seen must be considered as separate persons, each
one of them with a life and memory of its own&mdash;it may be
that these cells reckon time in a manner inconceivable by us, so
that no word can convey any idea of it whatever.&nbsp; What may
to them appear a long and painful process may to us be so
instantaneous as to escape us altogether, we wanting some
microscope to show us the details of time.&nbsp; If, in like
manner, we were to allow our imagination to conceive the
existence of a being as much in need of a microscope for our time
and affairs as we for those of our own component cells, the years
would be to such a being but as the winkings or the twinklings of
an eye.&nbsp; Would he think, then, that all the ants and flies
of one wink were different from those of the next? or would he
not rather believe that they were always the same flies, and,
again, always the same men and women, if he could see them at
all, and if the whole human race did not appear to him as a sort
of spreading and lichen-like growth over the earth, not
differentiated at all into individuals?&nbsp; With the help of a
microscope and the intelligent exercise of his reason, he would
in time conceive the truth.&nbsp; He would put Covent Garden
Market on the field of his microscope, and would perhaps write a
great deal of nonsense about the unerring &ldquo;instinct&rdquo;
which taught each costermonger to recognise his own basket or his
own donkey-cart; and this, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, is what we
are getting to do as regards our own bodies.&nbsp; What I wish
is, to make the same sort of step in an upward direction which
has already been taken in a downward one, and to show reason for
thinking that we are only component atoms of a single compound
creature, LIFE, which has probably a distinct conception of its
own personality though none whatever of ours, more than we of our
own units.&nbsp; I wish also to show reason for thinking that
this creature, LIFE, has only come to be what it is, by the same
sort of process as that by which any human art or manufacture is
developed, <i>i.e.</i>, through constantly doing the same thing
over and over again, beginning from something which is barely
recognisable as faith, or as the desire to know, or do, or live
at all, and as to the origin of which we are in utter
darkness,&mdash;and growing till it is first conscious of effort,
then conscious of power, then powerful with but little
consciousness, and finally, so powerful and so charged with
memory as to be absolutely without all self-consciousness
whatever, except as regards its latest phases in each of its many
differentiations, or when placed in such new circumstances as
compel it to choose between death and a reconsideration of its
position.</p>
<p>No conjecture can be hazarded as to how the smallest particle
of matter became so imbued with faith that it must be considered
as the beginning of <span class="GutSmall">LIFE</span>, or as to
what such faith is, except that it is the very essence of all
things, and that it has no foundation.</p>
<p>In this way, then, I conceive we can fairly transfer the
experience of the race to the individual, without any other
meaning to our words than what they would naturally suggest; that
is to say, that there is in every impregnate ovum a <i>bon&acirc;
fide</i> memory, which carries it back not only to the time when
it was last an impregnate ovum, but to that earlier date when it
was the very beginning of life at all, which same creature it
still is, whether as man or ovum, and hence imbued, so far as
time and circumstance allow, with all its memories.&nbsp; Surely
this is no strained hypothesis; for the mere fact that the germ,
from the earliest moment that we are able to detect it, appears
to be so perfectly familiar with its business, acts with so
little hesitation and so little introspection or reference to
principles, this alone should incline us to suspect that it must
be armed with that which, so far as we observe in daily life, can
alone ensure such a result&mdash;to wit, long practice, and the
memory of many similar performances.</p>
<p>The difficulty is, that we are conscious of no such memory in
our own persons, and beyond the one great proof of memory given
by the actual repetition of the performance&mdash;and of some of
the latest deviations from the ordinary performance (and this
proof ought in itself, one would have thought, to outweigh any
save the directest evidence to the contrary) we can detect no
symptom of any such mental operation as recollection on the part
of the embryo.&nbsp; On the other hand, we have seen that we know
most intensely those things that we are least conscious of
knowing; we will most intensely what we are least conscious of
willing; we feel continually without knowing that we feel, and
our attention is hourly arrested without our attention being
arrested by the arresting of our attention.&nbsp; Memory is no
less capable of unconscious exercise, and on becoming intense
through frequent repetition, vanishes no less completely as a
conscious action of the mind than knowledge and volition.&nbsp;
We must all be aware of instances in which it is plain we must
have remembered, without being in the smallest degree conscious
of remembering.&nbsp; Is it then absurd to suppose that our past
existences have been repeated on such a vast number of occasions
that the germ, linked on to all preceding germs, and, by once
having become part of their identity, imbued with all their
memories, remembers too intensely to be conscious of remembering,
and works on with the same kind of unconsciousness with which we
play, or walk, or read, until something unfamiliar happens to us?
and is it not singularly in accordance with this view that
consciousness should begin with that part of the creature&rsquo;s
performance with which it is least familiar, as having repeated
it least often&mdash;that is to say, in our own case, with the
commencement of our human life&mdash;at birth, or
thereabouts?</p>
<p>It is certainly noteworthy that the embryo is never at a loss,
unless something happens to it which has not usually happened to
its forefathers, and which in the nature of things it cannot
remember.</p>
<p>When events are happening to it which have ordinarily happened
to its forefathers, and which it would therefore remember, if it
was possessed of the kind of memory which we are here attributing
to it, <i>it acts precisely as it would act if it were possessed
of such memory</i>.</p>
<p>When, on the other hand, events are happening to it which, if
it has the kind of memory we are attributing to it, would baffle
that memory, or which have rarely or never been included in the
category of its recollections, <i>it acts precisely as a creature
acts when its recollection is disturbed</i>, <i>or when it is
required to do something which it has never done before</i>.</p>
<p>We cannot remember having been in the embryonic stage, but we
do not on that account deny that we ever were in such a stage at
all.&nbsp; On a little reflection it will appear no more
reasonable to maintain that, when we were in the embryonic stage,
we did not remember our past existences, than to say that we
never were embryos at all.&nbsp; We cannot remember what we did
or did not recollect in that state; we cannot now remember having
grown the eyes which we undoubtedly did grow, much less can we
remember whether or not we then remembered having grown them
before; but it is probable that our memory was then, in respect
of our previous existences as embryos, as much more intense than
it is now in respect of our childhood, as our power of acquiring
a new language was greater when we were one or two years old,
than when we were twenty.&nbsp; And why should this power of
acquiring languages be greater at two years than at twenty, but
that for many generations we have learnt to speak at about this
age, and hence look to learn to do so again on reaching it, just
as we looked to making eyes, when the time came at which we were
accustomed to make them.</p>
<p>If we once had the memory of having been infants (which we had
from day to day during infancy), and have lost it, we may well
have had other and more intense memories which we have lost no
less completely.&nbsp; Indeed, there is nothing more
extraordinary in the supposition that the impregnate ovum has an
intense sense of its continuity with, and therefore of its
identity with, the two impregnate ova from which it has sprung,
than in the fact that we have no sense of our continuity with
ourselves as infants.&nbsp; If then, there is no <i>&agrave;
priori</i> objection to this view, and if the impregnate ovum
acts in such a manner as to carry the strongest conviction that
it must have already on many occasions done what it is doing now,
and that it has a vivid though unconscious recollection of what
all, and more especially its nearer, ancestral ova did under
similar circumstances, there would seem to be little doubt what
conclusion we ought to come to.</p>
<p>A hen&rsquo;s egg, for example, as soon as the hen begins to
sit, sets to work immediately to do as nearly as may be what the
two eggs from which its father and mother were hatched did when
hens began to sit upon them.&nbsp; The inference would seem
almost irresistible,&mdash;that the second egg remembers the
course pursued by the eggs from which it has sprung, and of whose
present identity it is unquestionably a part-phase; it also seems
irresistibly forced upon us to believe that the intensity of this
memory is the secret of its easy action.</p>
<p>It has, I believe, been often remarked, that a hen is only an
egg&rsquo;s way of making another egg.&nbsp; Every creature must
be allowed to &ldquo;run&rdquo; its own development in its own
way; the egg&rsquo;s way may seem a very roundabout manner of
doing things; but it <i>is</i> its way, and it is one of which
man, upon the whole, has no great reason to complain.&nbsp; Why
the fowl should be considered more alive than the egg, and why it
should be said that the hen lays the egg, and not that the egg
lays the hen, these are questions which lie beyond the power of
philosophic explanation, but are perhaps most answerable by
considering the conceit of man, and his habit, persisted in
during many ages, of ignoring all that does not remind him of
himself, or hurt him, or profit him; also by considering the use
of language, which, if it is to serve at all, can only do so by
ignoring a vast number of facts which gradually drop out of mind
from being out of sight.&nbsp; But, perhaps, after all, the real
reason is, that the egg does not cackle when it has laid the hen,
and that it works towards the hen with gradual and noiseless
steps, which we can watch if we be so minded; whereas, we can
less easily watch the steps which lead from the hen to the egg,
but hear a noise, and see an egg where there was no egg.&nbsp;
Therefore, we say, the development of the fowl from the egg bears
no sort of resemblance to that of the egg from the fowl, whereas,
in truth, a hen, or any other living creature, is only the
primordial cell&rsquo;s way of going back upon itself.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; We see an egg, A, which evidently knows
its own meaning perfectly well, and we know that a twelvemonth
ago there were two other such eggs, B and C, which have now
disappeared, but from which we know A to have been so
continuously developed as to be part of the present form of their
identity.&nbsp; A&rsquo;s meaning is seen to be precisely the
same as B and C&rsquo;s meaning; A&rsquo;s personal appearance
is, to all intents and purposes, B and C&rsquo;s personal
appearance; it would seem, then, unreasonable to deny that A is
only B and C come back, with such modification as they may have
incurred since their disappearance; and that, in spite of any
such modification, they remember in A perfectly well what they
did as B and C.</p>
<p>We have considered the question of personal identity so as to
see whether, without abuse of terms, we can claim it as existing
between any two generations of living agents (and if between two,
then between any number up to infinity), and we found that we
were not only at liberty to claim this, but that we are compelled
irresistibly to do so, unless, that is to say, we would think
very differently concerning personal identity than we do at
present.&nbsp; We found it impossible to hold the ordinary common
sense opinions concerning personal identity, without admitting
that we are personally identical with all our forefathers, who
have successfully assimilated outside matter to themselves, and
by assimilation imbued it with all their own memories; we being
nothing else than this outside matter so assimilated and imbued
with such memories.&nbsp; This, at least, will, I believe,
balance the account correctly.</p>
<p>A few remarks upon the assimilation of outside matter by
living organisms may perhaps be hazarded here.</p>
<p>As long as any living organism can maintain itself in a
position to which it has been accustomed, more or less nearly,
both in its own life and in those of its forefathers, nothing can
harm it.&nbsp; As long as the organism is familiar with the
position, and remembers its antecedents, nothing can assimilate
it.&nbsp; It must be first dislodged from the position with which
it is familiar, as being able to remember it, before mischief can
happen to it.&nbsp; Nothing can assimilate living organism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the moment living organism loses sight of
its own position and antecedents, it is liable to immediate
assimilation, and to be thus familiarised with the position and
antecedents of some other creature.&nbsp; If any living organism
be kept for but a very short time in a position wholly different
from what it has been accustomed to in its own life, and in the
lives of its forefathers, it commonly loses its memories
completely, once and for ever; but it must immediately acquire
new ones, for nothing can know nothing; everything must remember
either its own antecedents, or some one else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And
as nothing can know nothing, so nothing can believe in
nothing.</p>
<p>A grain of corn, for example, has never been accustomed to
find itself in a hen&rsquo;s stomach&mdash;neither it nor its
forefathers.&nbsp; For a grain so placed leaves no offspring, and
hence cannot transmit its experience.&nbsp; The first minute or
so after being eaten, it may think it has just been sown, and
begin to prepare for sprouting, but in a few seconds, it
discovers the environment to be unfamiliar; it therefore gets
frightened, loses its head, is carried into the gizzard, and
comminuted among the gizzard stones.&nbsp; The hen succeeded in
putting it into a position with which it was unfamiliar; from
this it was an easy stage to assimilating it entirely.&nbsp; Once
assimilated, the grain ceases to remember any more as a grain,
but becomes initiated into all that happens to, and has happened
to, fowls for countless ages.&nbsp; Then it will attack all other
grains whenever it sees them; there is no such persecutor of
grain, as another grain when it has once fairly identified itself
with a hen.</p>
<p>We may remark in passing, that if anything be once
familiarised with anything, it is content.&nbsp; The only things
we really care for in life are familiar things; let us have the
means of doing what we have been accustomed to do, of dressing as
we have been accustomed to dress, of eating as we have been
accustomed to eat, and let us have no less liberty than we are
accustomed to have, and last, but not least, let us not be
disturbed in thinking as we have been accustomed to think, and
the vast majority of mankind will be very fairly
contented&mdash;all plants and animals will certainly be
so.&nbsp; This would seem to suggest a possible doctrine of a
future state; concerning which we may reflect that though, after
we die, we cease to be familiar with ourselves, we shall
nevertheless become immediately familiar with many other
histories compared with which our present life must then seem
intolerably uninteresting.</p>
<p>This is the reason why a very heavy and sudden shock to the
nervous system does not pain, but kills outright at once; while
one with which the system can, at any rate, try to familiarise
itself is exceedingly painful.&nbsp; We cannot bear
unfamiliarity.&nbsp; The part that is treated in a manner with
which it is not familiar cries immediately to the brain&mdash;its
central government&mdash;for help, and makes itself generally as
troublesome as it can, till it is in some way comforted.&nbsp;
Indeed, the law against cruelty to animals is but an example of
the hatred we feel on seeing even dumb creatures put into
positions with which they are not familiar.&nbsp; We hate this so
much for ourselves, that we will not tolerate it for other
creatures if we can possibly avoid it.&nbsp; So again, it is
said, that when Andromeda and Perseus had travelled but a little
way from the rock where Andromeda had so long been chained, she
began upbraiding him with the loss of her dragon, who, on the
whole, she said, had been very good to her.&nbsp; The only things
we really hate are unfamiliar things, and though nature would not
be nature if she did not cross our love of the familiar with a
love also of the unfamiliar, yet there can be no doubt which of
the two principles is master.</p>
<p>Let us return, however, to the grain of corn.&nbsp; If the
grain had had presence of mind to avoid being carried into the
gizzard stones, as many seeds do which are carried for hundreds
of miles in birds&rsquo; stomachs, and if it had persuaded itself
that the novelty of the position was not greater than it could
very well manage to put up with&mdash;if, in fact, it had not
known when it was beaten&mdash;it might have stuck in the
hen&rsquo;s stomach and begun to grow; in this case it would have
assimilated a good part of the hen before many days were over;
for hens are not familiar with grains that grow in their
stomachs, and unless the one in question was as strongminded for
a hen, as the grain that could avoid being assimilated would be
for a grain, the hen would soon cease to take an interest in her
antecedents.&nbsp; It is to be doubted, however, whether a grain
has ever been grown which has had strength of mind enough to
avoid being set off its balance on finding itself inside a
hen&rsquo;s gizzard.&nbsp; For living organism is the creature of
habit and routine, and the inside of a gizzard is not in the
grain&rsquo;s programme.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that the grain, instead of being carried into
the gizzard, had stuck in the hen&rsquo;s throat and choked
her.&nbsp; It would now find itself in a position very like what
it had often been in before.&nbsp; That is to say, it would be in
a damp, dark, quiet place, not too far from light, and with
decaying matter around it.&nbsp; It would therefore know
perfectly well what to do, and would begin to grow until
disturbed, and again put into a position with which it might,
very possibly, be unfamiliar.</p>
<p>The great question between vast masses of living organism is
simply this: &ldquo;Am I to put you into a position with which
your forefathers have been unfamiliar, or are you to put me into
one about which my own have been in like manner
ignorant?&rdquo;&nbsp; Man is only the dominant animal on the
earth, because he can, as a general rule, settle this question in
his own favour.</p>
<p>The only manner in which an organism, which has once forgotten
its antecedents, can ever recover its memory, is by being
assimilated by a creature of its own kind; one, moreover, which
knows its business, or is not in such a false position as to be
compelled to be aware of being so.&nbsp; It was, doubtless, owing
to the recognition of this fact, that some Eastern nations, as we
are told by Herodotus, were in the habit of eating their deceased
parents&mdash;for matter which has once been assimilated by any
identity or personality, becomes for all practical purposes part
of the assimilating personality.</p>
<p>The bearing of the above will become obvious when we return,
as we will now do, to the question of personal identity.&nbsp;
The only difficulty would seem to lie in our unfamiliarity with
the real meanings which we attach to words in daily use.&nbsp;
Hence, while recognising continuity without sudden break as the
underlying principle of identity, we forget that this involves
personal identity between all the beings who are in one chain of
descent, the numbers of such beings, whether in succession, or
contemporaneous, going for nothing at all.&nbsp; Thus we take two
eggs, one male and one female, and hatch them; after some months
the pair of fowls so hatched, having succeeded in putting a vast
quantity of grain and worms into false positions, become
full-grown, breed, and produce a dozen new eggs.</p>
<p>Two live fowls and a dozen eggs are the present phase of the
personality of the two original eggs.&nbsp; They are also part of
the present phase of the personality of all the worms and grain
which the fowls have assimilated from their leaving the eggshell;
but the personalities of these last do not count; they have lost
their grain and worm memories, and are instinct with the
memorises of the whole ancestry of the creature which has
assimilated them.</p>
<p>We cannot, perhaps, strictly say that the two fowls and the
dozen new eggs actually <i>are</i> the two original eggs; these
two eggs are no longer in existence, and we see the two birds
themselves which were hatched from them.&nbsp; A bird cannot be
called an egg without an abuse of terms.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it
is doubtful how far we should not say this, for it is only with a
mental reserve&mdash;and with no greater mental
reserve&mdash;that we predicate absolute identity concerning any
living being for two consecutive moments; and it is certainly as
free from quibble to say to two fowls and a dozen eggs,
&ldquo;you are the two eggs I had on my kitchen shelf twelve
months ago,&rdquo; as to say to a man, &ldquo;you are the child
whom I remember thirty years ago in your mother&rsquo;s
arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; In either case we mean, &ldquo;you have been
continually putting other organisms into a false position, and
then assimilating them, ever since I last saw you, while nothing
has yet occurred to put <i>you</i> into such a false position as
to have made you lose the memory of your antecedents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would seem perfectly fair, therefore, to say to any egg of
the twelve, or to the two fowls and the whole twelve eggs
together, &ldquo;you were a couple of eggs twelve months ago;
twelve months before that you were four eggs;&rdquo; and so on,
<i>ad infinitum</i>, the number neither of the ancestors nor of
the descendants counting for anything, and continuity being the
sole thing looked to.&nbsp; From daily observation we are
familiar with the fact that identity does both unite with other
identities, so that a single new identity is the result, and does
also split itself up into several identities, so that the one
becomes many.&nbsp; This is plain from the manner in which the
male and female sexual elements unite to form a single ovum,
which we observe to be instinct with the memories of both the
individuals from which it has been derived; and there is the
additional consideration, that each of the elements whose fusion
goes to make up the impregnate ovum, is held by some to be itself
composed of a fused mass of germs, which stand very much in the
same relation to the spermatozoon and ovum, as the living
cellular units of which we are composed do to
ourselves&mdash;that is to say, are living independent organisms,
which probably have no conception of the existence of the
spermatozoon nor of the ovum, more than the spermatozoon or ovum
have of theirs.</p>
<p>This, at least, is what I gather from Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
provisional theory of Pangenesis; and, again, from one of the
concluding sentences in his &ldquo;Effects of Cross and Self
Fertilisation,&rdquo; where, asking the question why two sexes
have been developed, he replies that the answer seems to lie
&ldquo;in the great good which is derived from the fusion of two
somewhat differentiated individuals.&nbsp; With the
exception,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;or the lowest organisms
this is possible only by means of the sexual
elements&mdash;<i>these consisting of cells separated from the
body</i>&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, separated from the bodies of each
parent) &ldquo;<i>containing the germs of every part</i>&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i>, consisting of the seeds or germs from which each
individual cell of the coming organism will be
developed&mdash;these seeds or germs having been shed by each
individual cell of the parent forms), &ldquo;<i>and capable of
being fused completely together</i>&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, so at
least I gather, capable of being fused completely, in the same
way as the cells of our own bodies are fused, and thus, of
forming a single living personality in the case of both the male
and female element; which elements are themselves capable of a
second fusion so as to form the impregnate ovum).&nbsp; This
single impregnate ovum, then, is a single identity that has taken
the place of and come up in the room of two distinct
personalities, each of whose characteristics it, to a certain
extent, partakes, and which consist, each one of them, of the
fused germs of a vast mass of other personalities.</p>
<p>As regards the dispersion of one identity into many, this also
is a matter of daily observation in the case of all female
creatures that are with egg or young; the identity of the young
with the female parent is in many respects so complete, as to
need no enforcing, in spite of the entrance into the offspring of
all the elements derived from the male parent, and of the gradual
separation of the two identities, which becomes more and more
complete, till in time it is hard to conceive that they can ever
have been united.</p>
<p>Numbers, therefore, go for nothing; and, as far as identity or
continued personality goes, it is as fair to say to the two
fowls, above referred to, &ldquo;you were four fowls twelve
months ago,&rdquo; as it is to say to a dozen eggs, &ldquo;you
were two eggs twelve months ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; But here a
difficulty meets us; for if we say, &ldquo;you were two eggs
twelve months ago,&rdquo; it follows that we mean, &ldquo;you are
now those two eggs;&rdquo; just as when we say to a person,
&ldquo;you were such and such a boy twenty years ago,&rdquo; we
mean, &ldquo;you are now that boy, or all that represents
him;&rdquo; it would seem, then, that in like manner we should
say to the two fowls, &ldquo;you <i>are</i> the four fowls who
between them laid the two eggs from which you
sprung.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it may be that all these four fowls are
still to be seen running about; we should be therefore saying,
&ldquo;you two fowls are really not yourselves only, but you are
also the other four fowls into the bargain;&rdquo; and this might
be philosophically true, and might, perhaps, be considered so,
but for the convenience of the law courts.</p>
<p>The difficulty would seem to arise from the fact that the eggs
must disappear before fowls can be hatched from them, whereas,
the hens so hatched may outlive the development of other hens,
from the eggs which they in due course have laid.&nbsp; The
original eggs being out of sight are out of mind, and it is
without an effort that we acquiesce in the assertion,&mdash;that
the dozen new eggs actually are the two original ones.&nbsp; But
the original four fowls being still in sight, cannot be ignored,
we only, therefore, see the new ones as growths from the original
ones.</p>
<p>The strict rendering of the facts should be, &ldquo;you are
part of the present phase of the identity of such and such a past
identity,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, either of the two eggs or the four
fowls, as the case may be; this will put the eggs and the fowls,
as it were, into the same box, and will meet both the
philosophical and legal requirement of the case, only it is a
little long.</p>
<p>So far then, as regards actual identity of personality; which,
we find, will allow us to say, that eggs are part of the present
phase of a certain past identity, whether of other eggs, or of
fowls, or chickens, and in like, manner that chickens are part of
the present phase of certain other chickens, or eggs, or fowls;
in fact, that anything is part of the present phase of any past
identity in the line of its ancestry.&nbsp; But as regards the
actual memory of such identity (unconscious memory, but still
clearly memory), we observe that the egg, as long as it is an
egg, appears to have a very distinct recollection of having been
an egg before, and the fowl of having been a fowl before, but
that neither egg nor fowl appear to have any recollection of any
other stage of their past existences, than the one corresponding
to that in which they are themselves at the moment existing.</p>
<p>So we, at six or seven years old, have no recollection of ever
having been infants, much less of having been embryos; but the
manner in which we shed our teeth and make new ones, and the way
in which we grow generally, making ourselves for the most part
exceedingly like what we made ourselves, in the person of some
one of our nearer ancestors, and not unfrequently repeating the
very blunders which we made upon that occasion when we come to a
corresponding age, proves most incontestably that we remember our
past existences, though too utterly to be capable of
introspection in the matter.&nbsp; So, when we grow wisdom teeth,
at the age it may be of one or two and twenty, it is plain we
remember our past existences at that age, however completely we
may have forgotten the earlier stages of our present
existence.&nbsp; It may be said that it is the jaw which
remembers, and not we, but it seems hard to deny the jaw a right
of citizenship in our personality; and in the case of a growing
boy, every part of him seems to remember equally well, and if
every part of him combined does not make <i>him</i>, there would
seem but little use in continuing the argument further.</p>
<p>In like manner, a caterpillar appears not to remember having
been an egg, either in its present or any past existence.&nbsp;
It has no concern with eggs as soon as it is hatched, but it
clearly remembers not only having been a caterpillar before, but
also having turned itself into a chrysalis before; for when the
time comes for it to do this, it is at no loss, as it would
certainly be if the position was unfamiliar, but it immediately
begins doing what it did when last it was in a like case,
repeating the process as nearly as the environment will allow,
taking every step in the same order as last time, and doing its
work with that ease and perfection which we observe to belong to
the force of habit, and to be utterly incompatible with any other
supposition than that of long long practice.</p>
<p>Once having become a chrysalis, its memory of its
caterpillarhood appears to leave it for good and all, not to
return until it again assumes the shape of a caterpillar by
process of descent.&nbsp; Its memory now overleaps all past
modifications, and reverts to the time when it was last what it
is now, and though it is probable that both caterpillar and
chrysalis, on any given day of their existence in either of these
forms, have some sort of dim power of recollecting what happened
to them yesterday, or the day before; yet it is plain their main
memory goes back to the corresponding day of their last existence
in their present form, the chrysalis remembering what happened to
it on such a day far more practically, though less consciously,
than what happened to it yesterday; and naturally, for yesterday
is but once, and its past existences have been legion.&nbsp;
Hence, it prepares its wings in due time, doing each day what it
did on the corresponding day of its last chrysalishood and at
length becoming a moth; whereon its circumstances are so changed
that it loses all sense of its identity as a chrysalis (as
completely as we, for precisely the same reason, lose all sense
of our identity with ourselves as infants), and remembers nothing
but its past existences as a moth.</p>
<p>We observe this to hold throughout the animal and vegetable
kingdoms.&nbsp; In any one phase of the existence of the lower
animals, we observe that they remember the corresponding stage,
and a little on either side of it, of all their past existences
for a very great length of time.&nbsp; In their present existence
they remember a little behind the present moment (remembering
more and more the higher they advance in the scale of life), and
being able to foresee about as much as they could foresee in
their past existences, sometimes more and sometimes less.&nbsp;
As with memory, so with prescience.&nbsp; The higher they advance
in the scale of life the more prescient they are.&nbsp; It must,
of course, be remembered, and will later on be more fully dwelt
upon, that no offspring can remember anything which happens to
its parents after it and its parents have parted company; and
this is why there is, perhaps, more irregularity as regards our
wisdom-teeth than about anything else that we grow; inasmuch as
it must not uncommonly have happened in a long series of
generations, that the offspring has been born before the parents
have grown their wisdom-teeth, and thus there will be faults in
the memory.</p>
<p>Is there, then, anything in memory, as we observe it in
ourselves and others, under circumstances in which we shall agree
in calling it memory pure and simple without ambiguity of
terms&mdash;is there anything in memory which bars us from
supposing it capable of overleaping a long time of abeyance, and
thus of enabling each impregnate ovum, or each grain, to remember
what it did when last in a like condition, and to go on
remembering the corresponding period of its prior developments
throughout the whole period of its present growth, though such
memory has entirely failed as regards the interim between any two
corresponding periods, and is not consciously recognised by the
individual as being exercised at all?</p>
<h2><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE ABEYANCE OF MEMORY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us assume, for the moment, that
the action of each impregnate germ is due to memory, which, as it
were, pulsates anew in each succeeding generation, so that
immediately on impregnation, the germ&rsquo;s memory reverts to
the last occasion on which it was in a like condition, and
recognising the position, is at no loss what to do.&nbsp; It is
plain that in all cases where there are two parents, that is to
say, in the greater number of cases, whether in the vegetable or
animal kingdoms, there must be two such last occasions, each of
which will have an equal claim upon the attention of the new
germ.&nbsp; Its memory would therefore revert to both, and though
it would probably adhere more closely to the course which it took
either as its father or its mother, and thus come out eventually
male or female, yet it would be not a little influenced by the
less potent memory.</p>
<p>And not only this, but each of the germs to which the memory
of the new germ reverts, is itself imbued with the memories of
its own parent germs, and these again with the memories of
preceding generations, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>; so that,
<i>ex hypothesi</i>, the germ must become instinct with all these
memories, epitomised as after long time, and unperceived though
they may well be, not to say obliterated in part or entirely so
far as many features are concerned, by more recent
impressions.&nbsp; In this case, we must conceive of the
impregnate germ as of a creature which has to repeat a
performance already repeated before on countless different
occasions, but with no more variation on the more recent ones
than is inevitable in the repetition of any performance by an
intelligent being.</p>
<p>Now if we take the most parallel case to this which we can
find, and consider what we should ourselves do under such
circumstances, that is to say, if we consider what course is
actually taken by beings who are influenced by what we all call
memory, when they repeat an already often-repeated performance,
and if we find a very strong analogy between the course so taken
by ourselves, and that which from whatever cause we observe to be
taken by a living germ, we shall surely be much inclined to think
that there must be a similarity in the causes of action in each
case; and hence, to conclude, that the action of the germ is due
to memory.</p>
<p>It will, therefore, be necessary to consider the general
tendency of our minds in regard to impressions made upon us, and
the memory of such impressions.</p>
<p>Deep impressions upon the memory are made in two ways,
differing rather in degree than kind, but with two somewhat
widely different results.&nbsp; They are made:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; By unfamiliar objects, or combinations, which come at
comparatively long intervals, and produce their effect, as it
were, by one hard blow.&nbsp; The effect of these will vary with
the unfamiliarity of the impressions themselves, and the manner
in which they seem likely to lead to a further development of the
unfamiliar, <i>i.e.</i>, with the question, whether they seem
likely to compel us to change our habits, either for better or
worse.</p>
<p>Thus, if an object or incident be very unfamiliar, as, we will
say, a whale or an iceberg to one travelling to America for the
first time, it will make a deep impression, though but little
affecting our interests; but if we struck against the iceberg and
were shipwrecked, or nearly so, it would produce a much deeper
impression, we should think much more about icebergs, and
remember much more about them, than if we had merely seen
one.&nbsp; So, also, if we were able to catch the whale and sell
its oil, we should have a deep impression made upon us.&nbsp; In
either case we see that the amount of unfamiliarity, either
present or prospective, is the main determinant of the depth of
the impression.</p>
<p>As with consciousness and volition, so with sudden
unfamiliarity.&nbsp; It impresses us more and more deeply the
more unfamiliar it is, until it reaches such a point of
impressiveness as to make no further impression at all; on which
we then and there die.&nbsp; For death only kills through
unfamiliarity&mdash;that is to say, because the new position,
whatever it is, is so wide a cross as compared with the old one,
that we cannot fuse the two so as to understand the combination;
hence we lose all recognition of, and faith in, ourselves and our
surroundings.</p>
<p>But however much we imagine we remember concerning the details
of any remarkable impression which has been made us by a single
blow, we do not remember as much or nearly as much as we think we
do.&nbsp; The subordinate details soon drop out of mind.&nbsp;
Those who think they remember even such a momentous matter as the
battle of Waterloo recall now probably but half-a-dozen episodes,
a gleam here, and a gleam there, so that what they call
remembering the battle of Waterloo, is, in fact, little more than
a kind of dreaming&mdash;so soon vanishes the memory of any
unrepeated occurrence.</p>
<p>As for smaller impressions, there is very little of what
happens to us in each week that will be in our memories a week
hence; a man of eighty remembers few of the unrepeated incidents
of his life beyond those of the last fortnight, a little here,
and a little there, forming a matter of perhaps six weeks or two
months in all, if everything that he can call to mind were acted
over again with no greater fulness than he can remember it.&nbsp;
As for incidents that have been often repeated, his mind strikes
a balance of its past reminiscences, remembering the two or three
last performances, and a general method of procedure, but nothing
more.</p>
<p>If, then, the recollection of all that is not very novel, or
very often repeated, so soon fades from our own minds, during
what we consider as our single lifetime, what wonder that the
details of our daily experience should find no place in that
brief epitome of them which is all we can give in so small a
volume as offspring?</p>
<p>If we cannot ourselves remember the hundred-thousandth part of
what happened to us during our own childhood, how can we expect
our offspring to remember more than what, through frequent
repetition, they can now remember as a residuum, or general
impression.&nbsp; On the other hand, whatever we remember in
consequence of but a single impression, we remember
consciously.&nbsp; We can at will recall details, and are
perfectly well aware, when we do so, that we are
recollecting.&nbsp; A man who has never seen death looks for the
first time upon the dead face of some near relative or
friend.&nbsp; He gazes for a few short minutes, but the
impression thus made does not soon pass out of his mind.&nbsp; He
remembers the room, the hour of the day or night, and if by day,
what sort of a day.&nbsp; He remembers in what part of the room,
and how disposed the body of the deceased was lying.&nbsp; Twenty
years afterwards he can, at will, recall all these matters to his
mind, and picture to himself the scene as he originally witnessed
it.</p>
<p>The reason is plain; the impression was very unfamiliar, and
affected the beholder, both as regards the loss of one who was
dear to him, and as reminding him with more than common force
that he will one day die himself.&nbsp; Moreover the impression
was a simple one, not involving much subordinate detail; we have
in this case, therefore, an example of the most lasting kind of
impression that can be made by a single unrepeated event.&nbsp;
But if we examine ourselves closely, we shall find that after a
lapse of years we do not remember as much as we think we do, even
in such a case as this; and that beyond the incidents above
mentioned, and the expression upon the face of the dead person,
we remember little of what we can so consciously and vividly
recall.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Deep impressions are also made by the repetition,
more or less often, of a feeble impression which, if unrepeated,
would have soon passed out of our minds.&nbsp; We observe,
therefore, that we remember best what we have done least
often&mdash;any unfamiliar deviation, that is to say, from our
ordinary method of procedure&mdash;and what we have done most
often, with which, therefore, we are most familiar; our memory
being mainly affected by the force of novelty and the force of
routine&mdash;the most unfamiliar, and the most familiar,
incidents or objects.</p>
<p>But we remember impressions which have been made upon us by
force of routine, in a very different way to that in which we
remember a single deep impression.&nbsp; As regards this second
class, which comprises far the most numerous and important of the
impressions with which our memory is stored, it is often only by
the fact of our performance itself that we are able to recognise
or show to others that we remember at all.&nbsp; We often do not
remember how, or when, or where we acquired our knowledge.&nbsp;
All we remember is, that we did learn, and that at one time and
another we have done this or that very often.</p>
<p>As regards this second class of impressions we may
observe:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That as a general rule we remember only the
individual features of the last few repetitions of the
act&mdash;if, indeed, we remember this much.&nbsp; The influence
of preceding ones is to be found only in the general average of
the procedure, which is modified by them, but unconsciously to
ourselves.&nbsp; Take, for example, some celebrated singer, or
pianoforte player, who has sung the same air, or performed the
same sonata several hundreds or, it may be, thousands of times:
of the details of individual performances, he can probably call
to mind none but those of the last few days, yet there can be no
question that his present performance is affected by, and
modified by, all his previous ones; the care he has bestowed on
these being the secret of his present proficiency.</p>
<p>In each performance (the performer being supposed in the same
state of mental and bodily health), the tendency will be to
repeat the immediately preceding performances more nearly than
remoter ones.&nbsp; It is the common tendency of living beings to
go on doing what they have been doing most recently.&nbsp; The
last habit is the strongest.&nbsp; Hence, if he took great pains
last time, he will play better now, and will take a like degree
of pains, and play better still next time, and so go on improving
while life and vigour last.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, he took
less pains last time, he will play worse now, and be inclined to
take little pains next time, and so gradually deteriorate.&nbsp;
This, at least, is the common everyday experience of mankind.</p>
<p>So with painters, actors, and professional men of every
description; after a little while the memory of many past
performances strikes a sort of fused balance in the mind, which
results in a general method of procedure with but little
conscious memory of even the latest performances, and with none
whatever of by far the greater number of the remoter ones.</p>
<p>Still, it is noteworthy, that the memory of some even of these
will occasionally assert itself, so far as we can see,
arbitrarily, the reason why this or that occasion should still
haunt us, when others like them are forgotten, depending on some
cause too subtle for our powers of observation.</p>
<p>Even with such a simple matter as our daily dressing and
undressing, we may remember some few details of our
yesterday&rsquo;s toilet, but we retain nothing but a general and
fused recollection of the many thousand earlier occasions on
which we have dressed, or gone to bed.&nbsp; Men invariably put
the same leg first into their trousers&mdash;this is the survival
of memory in a residuum; but they cannot, till they actually put
on a pair of trousers, remember which leg they <i>do</i> put in
first; this is the rapid fading away of any small individual
impression.</p>
<p>The seasons may serve as another illustration; we have a
general recollection of the kind of weather which is seasonable
for any month in a year; what flowers are due about what time,
and whether the spring is on the whole backward or early; but we
cannot remember the weather on any particular day a year ago,
unless some unusual incident has impressed it upon our
memory.&nbsp; We can remember, as a general rule, what kind of
season it was, upon the whole, a year ago, or perhaps, even two
years; but more than this, we rarely remember, except in such
cases as the winter of 1854&ndash;1855, or the summer of 1868;
the rest is all merged.</p>
<p>We observe, then, that as regards small and often repeated
impressions, our tendency is to remember best, and in most
detail, what we have been doing most recently, and what in
general has occurred most recently, but that the earlier
impressions though forgotten individually, are nevertheless, not
wholly lost.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When we have done anything very often, and have got
into the habit of doing it, we generally take the various steps
in the same order; in many cases this seems to be a <i>sine
qu&acirc; non</i> for our repetition of the action at all.&nbsp;
Thus, there is probably no living man who could repeat the words
of &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; backwards, without much
hesitation and many mistakes; so the musician and the singer must
perform their pieces in the order of the notes as written, or at
any rate as they ordinarily perform them; they cannot transpose
bars or read them backwards, without being put out, nor would the
audience recognise the impressions they have been accustomed to,
unless these impressions are made in the accustomed order.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If, when we have once got well into the habit of
doing anything in a certain way, some one shows us some other way
of doing it, or some way which would in part modify our
procedure, or if in our endeavours to improve, we have hit upon
some new idea which seems likely to help us, and thus we vary our
course, on the next occasion we remember this idea by reason of
its novelty, but if we try to repeat it, we often find the
residuum of our old memories pulling us so strongly into our old
groove, that we have the greatest difficulty in repeating our
performance in the new manner; there is a clashing of memories, a
conflict, which if the idea is very new, and involves, so to
speak, too sudden a cross&mdash;too wide a departure from our
ordinary course&mdash;will sometimes render the performance
monstrous, or baffle us altogether, the new memory failing to
fuse harmoniously with the old.&nbsp; If the idea is not too
widely different from our older ones, we can cross them with it,
but with more or less difficulty, as a general rule in proportion
to the amount of variation.&nbsp; The whole process of
understanding a thing consists in this, and, so far as I can see
at present, in this only.</p>
<p>Sometimes we repeat the new performance for a few times, in a
way which shows that the fusion of memories is still in force;
and then insensibly revert to the old, in which case the memory
of the new soon fades away, leaving a residuum too feeble to
contend against that of our many earlier memories of the same
kind.&nbsp; If, however, the new way is obviously to our
advantage, we make an effort to retain it, and gradually getting
into the habit of using it, come to remember it by force of
routine, as we originally remembered it by force of
novelty.&nbsp; Even as regards our own discoveries, we do not
always succeed in remembering our most improved and most striking
performances, so as to be able to repeat them at will
immediately: in any such performance we may have gone some way
beyond our ordinary powers, owing to some unconscious action of
the mind.&nbsp; The supreme effort has exhausted us, and we must
rest on our oars a little, before we make further progress; or we
may even fall back a little, before we make another leap in
advance.</p>
<p>In this respect, almost every conceivable degree of variation
is observable, according to differences of character and
circumstances.&nbsp; Sometimes the new impression has to be made
upon us many times from without, before the earlier strain of
action is eliminated; in this case, there will long remain a
tendency to revert to the earlier habit.&nbsp; Sometimes, after
the impression has been once made, we repeat our old way two or
three times, and then revert to the new, which gradually ousts
the old; sometimes, on the other hand, a single impression,
though involving considerable departure from our routine, makes
its mark so deeply that we adopt the new at once, though not
without difficulty, and repeat it in our next performance, and
henceforward in all others; but those who vary their performance
thus readily will show a tendency to vary subsequent performances
according as they receive fresh ideas from others, or reason them
out independently.&nbsp; They are men of genius.</p>
<p>This holds good concerning all actions which we do habitually,
whether they involve laborious acquirement or not.&nbsp; Thus, if
we have varied our usual dinner in some way that leaves a
favourable impression upon our minds, so that our dinner may, in
the language of the horticulturist, be said to have
&ldquo;sported,&rdquo; our tendency will be to revert to this
particular dinner either next day, or as soon as circumstances
will allow, but it is possible that several hundred dinners may
elapse before we can do so successfully, or before our memory
reverts to this particular dinner.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As regards our habitual actions, however
unconsciously we remember them, we, nevertheless, remember them
with far greater intensity than many individual impressions or
actions, it may be of much greater moment, that have happened to
us more recently.&nbsp; Thus, many a man who has familiarised
himself, for example, with the odes of Horace, so as to have had
them at his fingers&rsquo; ends as the result of many
repetitions, will be able years hence to repeat a given ode,
though unable to remember any circumstance in connection with his
having learnt it, and no less unable to remember when he repeated
it last.&nbsp; A host of individual circumstances, many of them
not unimportant, will have dropped out of his mind, along with a
mass of literature read but once or twice, and not impressed upon
the memory by several repetitions; but he returns to the
well-known ode with so little effort, that he would not know that
he was remembering unless his reason told him so.&nbsp; The ode
seems more like something born with him.</p>
<p>We observe, also, that people who have become imbecile, or
whose memory is much impaired, yet frequently retain their power
of recalling impression which have been long ago repeatedly made
upon them.</p>
<p>In such cases, people are sometimes seen to forget what
happened last week, yesterday, or an hour ago, without even the
smallest power of recovering their recollection; but the oft
repeated earlier impression remains, though there may be no
memory whatever of how it came to be impressed so deeply.&nbsp;
The phenomena of memory, therefore, are exactly like those of
consciousness and volition, in so far as that the consciousness
of recollection vanishes, when the power of recollection has
become intense.&nbsp; When we are aware that we are recollecting,
and are trying, perhaps hard, to recollect, it is a sign that we
do not recollect utterly.&nbsp; When we remember utterly and
intensely, there is no conscious effort of recollection; our
recollection can only be recognised by ourselves and others,
through our performance itself, which testifies to the existence
of a memory, that we could not otherwise follow or detect.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; When circumstances have led us to change our habits
of life&mdash;as when the university has succeeded school, or
professional life the university&mdash;we get into many fresh
ways, and leave many old ones.&nbsp; But on revisiting the old
scene, unless the lapse of time has been inordinately great, we
experience a desire to revert to old habits.&nbsp; We say that
old associations crowd upon us.&nbsp; Let a Trinity man, after
thirty years absence from Cambridge, pace for five minutes in the
cloister of Neville&rsquo;s Court, and listen to the echo of his
footfall, as it licks up against the end of the cloister, or let
an old Johnian stand wherever he likes in the third Court of St.
John&rsquo;s, in either case he will find the thirty years drop
out of his life, as if they were half-an-hour; his life will have
rolled back upon itself, to the date when he was an
undergraduate, and his instinct will be to do almost
mechanically, whatever it would have come most natural to him to
do, when he was last there at the same season of the year, and
the same hour of the day; and it is plain this is due to
similarity of environment, for if the place he revisits be much
changed, there will be little or no association.</p>
<p>So those who are accustomed at intervals to cross the
Atlantic, get into certain habits on board ship, different to
their usual ones.&nbsp; It may be that at home they never play
whist; on board ship they do nothing else all the evening.&nbsp;
At home they never touch spirits; on the voyage they regularly
take a glass of something before they go to bed.&nbsp; They do
not smoke at home; here they are smoking all day.&nbsp; Once the
voyage is at an end, they return without an effort to their usual
habits, and do not feel any wish for cards, spirits, or
tobacco.&nbsp; They do not remember yesterday, when they did want
all these things; at least, not with such force as to be
influenced by it in their desires and actions; their true
memory&mdash;the memory which makes them want, and do, reverts to
the last occasion on which they were in circumstances like their
present; they therefore want now what they wanted then, and
nothing more; but when the time comes for them to go on shipboard
again, no sooner do they smell the smell of the ship, than their
real memory reverts to the times when they were last at sea, and
striking a balance of their recollections, they smoke, play
cards, and drink whisky and water.</p>
<p>We observe it then as a matter of the commonest daily
occurrence within our own experience, that memory does fade
completely away, and recur with the recurrence of surroundings
like those which made any particular impression in the first
instance.&nbsp; We observe that there is hardly any limit to the
completeness and the length of time during which our memory may
remain in abeyance.&nbsp; A smell may remind an old man of eighty
of some incident of his childhood, forgotten for nearly as many
years as he has lived.&nbsp; In other words, we observe that when
an impression has been repeatedly made in a certain sequence on
any living organism&mdash;that impression not having been
prejudicial to the creature itself&mdash;the organism will have a
tendency, on reassuming the shape and conditions in which it was
when the impression was last made, to remember the impression,
and therefore to do again now what it did then; all intermediate
memories dropping clean out of mind, so far as they have any
effect upon action.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Finally, we should note the suddenness and apparent
caprice with which memory will assert itself at odd times; we
have been saying or doing this or that, when suddenly a memory of
something which happened to us, perhaps in infancy, comes into
our head; nor can we in the least connect this recollection with
the subject of which we have just been thinking, though doubtless
there has been a connection, too rapid and subtle for our
apprehension.</p>
<p>The foregoing phenomena of memory, so far as we can judge,
would appear to be present themselves throughout the animal and
vegetable kingdoms.&nbsp; This will be readily admitted as
regards animals; as regards plants it may be inferred from the
fact that they generally go on doing what they have been doing
most lately, though accustomed to make certain changes at certain
points in their existence.&nbsp; When the time comes for these
changes, they appear to know it, and either bud forth into leaf
or shed their leaves, as the case may be.&nbsp; If we keep a bulb
in a paper bag it seems to remember having been a bulb before,
until the time comes for it to put forth roots and grow.&nbsp;
Then, if we supply it with earth and moisture, it seems to know
where it is, and to go on doing now whatever it did when it was
last planted; but if we keep it in the bag too long, it knows
that it ought, according to its last experience, to be treated
differently, and shows plain symptoms of uneasiness; it is
distracted by the bag, which makes it remember its bulbhood, and
also by the want of earth and water, without which associations
its memory of its previous growth cannot be duly kindled.&nbsp;
Its roots, therefore, which are most accustomed to earth and
water, do not grow; but its leaves, which do not require contact
with these things to jog their memory, make a more decided effort
at development&mdash;a fact which would seem to go strongly in
favour of the functional independence of the parts of all but the
very simplest living organisms, if, indeed, more evidence were
wanted in support of this.</p>

166</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND IF
DIFFERENTIATIONS OF STRUCTURE AND INSTINCT ARE MAINLY DUE TO
MEMORY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> repeat briefly;&mdash;we
remember best our last few performances of any given kind, and
our present performance is most likely to resemble one or other
of these; we only remember our earlier performances by way of
residuum; nevertheless, at times, some older feature is liable to
reappear.</p>
<p>We take our steps in the same order on each successive
occasion, and are for the most part incapable of changing that
order.</p>
<p>The introduction of slightly new elements into our manner is
attended with benefit; the new can be fused with the old, and the
monotony of our action is relieved.&nbsp; But if the new element
is too foreign, we cannot fuse the old and new&mdash;nature
seeming equally to hate too wide a deviation from our ordinary
practice, and no deviation at all.&nbsp; Or, in plain
English&mdash;if any one gives us a new idea which is not too far
ahead of us, such an idea is often of great service to us, and
may give new life to our work&mdash;in fact, we soon go back,
unless we more or less frequently come into contact with new
ideas, and are capable of understanding and making use of them;
if; on the other hand, they are too new, and too little led up
to, so that we find them too strange and hard to be able to
understand them and adopt them, then they put us out, with every
degree of completeness&mdash;from simply causing us to fail in
this or that particular part, to rendering us incapable of even
trying to do our work at all, from pure despair of
succeeding.</p>
<p>It requires many repetitions to fix an impression firmly; but
when it is fixed, we cease to have much recollection of the
manner in which it came to be so, or of any single and particular
recurrence.</p>
<p>Our memory is mainly called into action by force of
association and similarity in the surroundings.&nbsp; We want to
go on doing what we did when we were last as we are now, and we
forget what we did in the meantime.</p>
<p>These rules, however, are liable to many exceptions; as for
example, that a single and apparently not very extraordinary
occurrence may sometimes produce a lasting impression, and be
liable to return with sudden force at some distant time, and then
to go on returning to us at intervals.&nbsp; Some incidents, in
fact, we know not how nor why, dwell with us much longer than
others which were apparently quite as noteworthy or perhaps more
so.</p>
<p>Now I submit that if the above observations are just, and if,
also, the offspring, after having become a new and separate
personality, yet retains so much of the old identity of which it
was once indisputably part, that it remembers what it did when it
was part of that identity as soon as it finds itself in
circumstances which are calculated to refresh its memory owing to
their similarity to certain antecedent ones, then we should
expect to find:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That offspring should, as a general rule, resemble
its own most immediate progenitors; that is to say, that it
should remember best what it has been doing most recently.&nbsp;
The memory being a fusion of its recollections of what it did,
both when it was its father and also when it was its mother, the
offspring should have a very common tendency to resemble both
parents, the one in some respects, and the other in others; but
it might also hardly less commonly show a more marked
recollection of the one history than of the other, thus more
distinctly resembling one parent than the other.&nbsp; And this
is what we observe to be the case.&nbsp; Not only so far as that
the offspring is almost invariably either male or female, and
generally resembles rather the one parent than the other, but
also that in spite of such preponderance of one set of
recollections, the sexual characters and instincts of the
<i>opposite</i> sex appear, whether in male or female, though
undeveloped and incapable of development except by abnormal
treatment, such as has occasionally caused milk to be developed
in the mammary glands of males; or by mutilation, or failure of
sexual instinct through age, upon which, male characteristics
frequently appear in the females of any species.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, each giving their own version of the
same story, though in different words, should resemble each other
more closely than more distant relations.&nbsp; This too we
see.</p>
<p>But it should frequently happen that offspring should resemble
its penultimate rather than its latest phase, and should thus be
more like a grand-parent than a parent; for we observe that we
very often repeat a performance in a manner resembling that of
some earlier, but still recent, repetition; rather than on the
precise lines of our very last performance.&nbsp; First-cousins
may in this case resemble each other more closely than brothers
and sisters.</p>
<p>More especially, we should not expect very successful men to
be fathers of particularly gifted children; for the best men are,
as it were, the happy thoughts and successes of the
race&mdash;nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;flukes,&rdquo; so to speak, in
her onward progress.&nbsp; No creature can repeat at will, and
immediately, its highest flight.&nbsp; It needs repose.&nbsp; The
generations are the essays of any given race towards the highest
ideal which it is as yet able to see ahead of itself, and this,
in the nature of things, cannot be very far; so that we should
expect to see success followed by more or less failure, and
failure by success&mdash;a very successful creature being a
<i>great</i> &ldquo;fluke.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this is what we
find.</p>
<p>In its earlier stages the embryo should be simply conscious of
a general method of procedure on the part of its forefathers, and
should, by reason of long practice, compress tedious and
complicated histories into a very narrow compass, remembering no
single performance in particular.&nbsp; For we observe this in
nature, both as regards the sleight-of-hand which practice gives
to those who are thoroughly familiar with their business, and
also as regards the fusion of remoter memories into a general
residuum.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; We should expect to find that the offspring, whether
in its embryonic condition, or in any stage of development till
it has reached maturity, should adopt nearly the same order in
going through all its various stages.&nbsp; There should be such
slight variations as are inseparable from the repetition of any
performance by a living being (as contrasted with a machine), but
no more.&nbsp; And this is what actually happens.&nbsp; A man may
cut his wisdom-teeth a little later than he gets his beard and
whiskers, or a little earlier; but on the whole, he adheres to
his usual order, and is completely set off his balance, and upset
in his performance, if that order be interfered with
suddenly.&nbsp; It is, however, likely that gradual modifications
of order have been made and then adhered to.</p>
<p>After any animal has reached the period at which it ordinarily
begins to continue its race, we should expect that it should show
little further power of development, or, at any rate, that few
great changes of structure or fresh features should appear; for
we cannot suppose offspring to remember anything that happens to
the parent subsequently to the parent&rsquo;s ceasing to contain
the offspring within itself; from the average age, therefore, of
reproduction, offspring would cease to have any further
experience on which to fall back, and would thus continue to make
the best use of what it already knew, till memory failing either
in one part or another, the organism would begin to decay.</p>
<p>To this cause must be referred the phenomena of old age, which
interesting subject I am unable to pursue within the limits of
this volume.</p>
<p>Those creatures who are longest in reaching maturity might be
expected also to be the longest lived; I am not certain, however,
how far what is called alternate generation militates against
this view, but I do not think it does so seriously.</p>
<p>Lateness of marriage, provided the constitution of the
individuals marrying is in no respect impaired, should also tend
to longevity.</p>
<p>I believe that all the above will be found sufficiently well
supported by facts.&nbsp; If so, when we feel that we are getting
old we should try and give our cells such treatment as they will
find it most easy to understand, through their experience of
their own individual life, which, however, can only guide them
inferentially, and to a very small extent; and throughout life we
should remember the important bearing which memory has upon
health, and both occasionally cross the memories of our component
cells with slightly new experiences, and be careful not to put
them either suddenly or for long together into conditions which
they will not be able to understand.&nbsp; Nothing is so likely
to make our cells forget themselves, as neglect of one or other
of these considerations.&nbsp; They will either fail to recognise
themselves completely, in which case we shall die; or they will
go on strike, more or less seriously as the case may be, or
perhaps, rather, they will try and remember their usual course,
and fail; they will therefore try some other, and will probably
make a mess of it, as people generally do when they try to do
things which they do not understand, unless indeed they have very
exceptional capacity.</p>
<p>It also follows that when we are ill, our cells being in such
or such a state of mind, and inclined to hold a corresponding
opinion with more or less unreasoning violence, should not be
puzzled more than they are puzzled already, by being contradicted
too suddenly; for they will not be in a frame of mind which can
understand the position of an open opponent: they should
therefore either be let alone, if possible, without notice other
than dignified silence, till their spleen is over, and till they
have remembered themselves; or they should be reasoned with as by
one who agrees with them, and who is anxious to see things as far
as possible from their own point of view.&nbsp; And this is how
experience teaches that we must deal with monomaniacs, whom we
simply infuriate by contradiction, but whose delusion we can
sometimes persuade to hang itself if we but give it sufficient
rope.&nbsp; All which has its bearing upon politics, too, at much
sacrifice, it may be, of political principles, but a politician
who cannot see principles where principle-mongers fail to see
them, is a dangerous person.</p>
<p>I may say, in passing, that the reason why a small wound
heals, and leaves no scar, while a larger one leaves a mark which
is more or less permanent, may be looked for in the fact that
when the wound is only small, the damaged cells are snubbed, so
to speak, by the vast majority of the unhurt cells in their own
neighbourhood.&nbsp; When the wound is more serious they can
stick to it, and bear each other out that they were hurt.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; We should expect to find a predominance of sexual
over asexual generation, in the arrangements of nature for
continuing her various species, inasmuch as two heads are better
than one, and a <i>locus p&oelig;nitenti&aelig;</i> is thus given
to the embryo&mdash;an opportunity of correcting the experience
of one parent by that of the other.&nbsp; And this is what the
more intelligent embryos may be supposed to do; for there would
seem little reason to doubt that there are clever embryos and
stupid embryos, with better or worse memories, as the case may
be, of how they dealt with their protoplasm before, and better or
worse able to see how they can do better now; and that embryos
differ as widely in intellectual and moral capacity, and in a
general sense of the fitness of things, and of what will look
well into the bargain, as those larger embryos&mdash;to wit,
children&mdash;do.&nbsp; Indeed it would seem probable that all
our mental powers must go through a quasi-embryological
condition, much as the power of keeping, and wisely spending,
money must do so, and that all the qualities of human thought and
character are to be found in the embryo.</p>
<p>Those who have observed at what an early age differences of
intellect and temper show themselves in the young, for example,
of cats and dogs, will find it difficult to doubt that from the
very moment of impregnation, and onward, there has been a
corresponding difference in the embryo&mdash;and that of six
unborn puppies, one, we will say, has been throughout the whole
process of development more sensible and better looking&mdash;a
nicer embryo, in fact&mdash;than the others.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; We should expect to find that all species, whether
of plants or animals, are occasionally benefited by a cross; but
we should also expect that a cross should have a tendency to
introduce a disturbing element, if it be too wide, inasmuch as
the offspring would be pulled hither and thither by two
conflicting memories or advices, much as though a number of
people speaking at once were without previous warning to advise
an unhappy performer to vary his ordinary performance&mdash;one
set of people telling him he has always hitherto done thus, and
the other saying no less loudly that he did it thus;&mdash;and he
were suddenly to become convinced that they each spoke the
truth.&nbsp; In such a case he will either completely break down,
if the advice be too conflicting, or if it be less conflicting,
he may yet be so exhausted by the one supreme effort of fusing
these experiences that he will never be able to perform again; or
if the conflict of experience be not great enough to produce such
a permanent effect as this, it will yet, if it be at all serious,
probably damage his performances on their next several occasions,
through his inability to fuse the experiences into a harmonious
whole, or, in other words, to understand the ideas which are
prescribed to him; for to fuse is only to understand.</p>
<p>And this is absolutely what we find in fact.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin
writes concerning hybrids and first crosses:&mdash;&ldquo;The
male element may reach the female element, but be incapable of
causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case
with some of Thuret&rsquo;s experiments on Fuci.&nbsp; No
explanation can be given of these facts any more than why certain
trees cannot be grafted on others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I submit that what I have written above supplies a very fair
<i>prim&acirc; facie</i> explanation.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at
an early period.&nbsp; This latter alternative has not been
sufficiently attended to; but I believe, from observations
communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in
hybridising pheasants and fowls, that the early death of the
embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first
crosses.&nbsp; Mr. Salter has recently given the results of an
examination of about five hundred eggs produced from various
crosses between three species of Gallus and their hybrids; the
majority of these eggs had been fertilised; and in the majority
of the fertilised eggs, the embryos had either been partially
developed, and had then perished, or had become nearly mature,
but the young chickens had been unable to break through the
shell.&nbsp; Of the chickens which were born more than
four-fifths died within the first few days, or at latest weeks,
&lsquo;without any obvious cause, apparently from mere inability
to live,&rsquo; so that from the five hundred eggs only twelve
chickens were reared&rdquo; (&ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo;
249, ed. 1876).</p>
<p>No wonder the poor creatures died, distracted as they were by
the internal tumult of conflicting memories.&nbsp; But they must
have suffered greatly; and the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals may perhaps think it worth while to keep an
eye even on the embryos of hybrids and first crosses.&nbsp; Five
hundred creatures puzzled to death is not a pleasant subject for
contemplation.&nbsp; Ten or a dozen should, I think, be
sufficient for the future.</p>
<p>As regards plants, we read:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hybridised embryos probably often perish in like manner
. . . of which fact Max Wichura has given some striking cases
with hybrid willows . . . It may be here worth noticing, that in
some cases of parthenogenesis, the embryos within the eggs of
silk moths, which have not been fertilised, pass through their
early stages of development, and then perish like the embryos
produced by a cross between distinct species&rdquo;
(<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>This last fact would at first sight seem to make against me,
but we must consider that the presence of a double memory,
provided it be not too conflicting, would be a part of the
experience of the silk moth&rsquo;s egg, which might be then as
fatally puzzled by the monotony of a single memory as it would be
by two memories which were not sufficiently like each
other.&nbsp; So that failure here must be referred to the utter
absence of that little internal stimulant of slightly conflicting
memory which the creature has always hitherto experienced, and
without which it fails to recognise itself.&nbsp; In either case,
then, whether with hybrids or in cases of parthenogenesis, the
early death of the embryo is due to inability to recollect, owing
to a fault in the chain of associated ideas.&nbsp; All the facts
here given are an excellent illustration of the principle,
elsewhere insisted upon by Mr. Darwin, that <i>any</i> great and
sudden change of surroundings has a tendency to induce sterility;
on which head he writes (&ldquo;Plants and Animals under
Domestication,&rdquo; vol. ii. p. 143, ed. 1875):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would appear that any change in the habits of life,
whatever their habits may be, if great enough, tends to affect in
an inexplicable manner the powers of reproduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again on the next page:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, we must conclude, limited though the
conclusion is, that changed conditions of life have an especial
power of acting injuriously on the reproductive system.&nbsp; The
whole case is quite peculiar, for these organs, though not
diseased, are thus rendered incapable of performing their proper
functions, or perform them imperfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One is inclined to doubt whether the blame may not rest with
the inability on the part of the creature reproduced to recognise
the new surroundings, and hence with its failing to know
itself.&nbsp; And this seems to be in some measure
supported&mdash;but not in such a manner as I can hold to be
quite satisfactory&mdash;by the continuation of the passage in
the &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; from which I have just been
quoting&mdash;for Mr. Darwin goes on to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before
and after birth.&nbsp; When born, and living in a country where
their parents live, they are generally placed under suitable
conditions of life.&nbsp; But a hybrid partakes of only half of
the nature and condition of its mother; it may therefore before
birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother&rsquo;s womb,
or within the egg or seed produced by its mother, be exposed to
conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable
to perish at an early period . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; After which,
however, the conclusion arrived at is, that, &ldquo;after all,
the cause more probably lies in some imperfection in the original
act of impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly
developed rather than in the conditions to which it is
subsequently exposed.&rdquo;&nbsp; A conclusion which I am not
prepared to accept.</p>
<p>Returning to my second alternative, that is to say, to the
case of hybrids which are born well developed and healthy, but
nevertheless perfectly sterile, it is less obvious why, having
succeeded in understanding the conflicting memories of their
parents, they should fail to produce offspring; but I do not
think the reader will feel surprised that this should be the
case.&nbsp; The following anecdote, true or false, may not be out
of place here:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plutarch tells us of a magpie, belonging to a barber at
Rome, which could imitate to a nicety almost every word it
heard.&nbsp; Some trumpets happened one day to be sounded before
the shop, and for a day or two afterwards the magpie was quite
mute, and seemed pensive and melancholy.&nbsp; All who knew it
were greatly surprised at its silence; and it was supposed that
the sound of the trumpets had so stunned it as to deprive it at
once of both voice and hearing.&nbsp; It soon appeared, however,
that this was far from being the case; for, says Plutarch, the
bird had been all the time occupied in profound meditation,
studying how to imitate the sound of the trumpets; and when at
last master of it, the magpie, to the astonishment of all its
friends, suddenly broke its long silence by a perfect imitation
of the flourish of trumpets it had heard, observing with the
greatest exactness all the repetitions, stops, and changes.&nbsp;
<i>The acquisition of this lesson had</i>, <i>however</i>,
<i>exhausted the whole of the magpie&rsquo;s stock of
intellect</i>, <i>for it made it forget everything it had learned
before</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Percy Anecdotes,&rdquo; Instinct, p.
166).</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, more seriously, the memory of every impregnate
ovum from which every ancestor of a mule, for example, has
sprung, has reverted to a very long period of time during which
its forefathers have been creatures like that which it is itself
now going to become: thus, the impregnate ovum from which the
mule&rsquo;s father was developed remembered nothing but horse
memories; but it felt its faith in these supported by the
recollection of a <i>vast number</i> of previous generations, in
which it was, to all intents and purposes, what it now is.&nbsp;
In like manner, the impregnate ovum from which the mule&rsquo;s
mother was developed would be backed by the assurance that it had
done what it is going to do now a hundred thousand times
already.&nbsp; All would thus be plain sailing.&nbsp; A horse and
a donkey would result.&nbsp; These two are brought together; an
impregnate ovum is produced which finds an unusual conflict of
memory between the two lines of its ancestors, nevertheless,
being accustomed to <i>some</i> conflict, it manages to get over
the difficulty, <i>as on either side it finds itself backed by a
very long series of sufficiently steady memory</i>.&nbsp; A mule
results&mdash;a creature so distinctly different from either
horse or donkey, that reproduction is baffled, owing to the
creature&rsquo;s having nothing but its own knowledge of itself
to fall back upon, behind which there comes an immediate
dislocation, or fault of memory, which is sufficient to bar
identity, and hence reproduction, by rendering too severe an
appeal to reason necessary&mdash;for no creature can reproduce
itself on the shallow foundation which reason can alone
give.&nbsp; Ordinarily, therefore, the hybrid, or the
spermatozoon or ovum, which it may throw off (as the case may
be), finds one single experience too small to give it the
necessary faith, on the strength of which even to try to
reproduce itself.&nbsp; In other cases the hybrid itself has
failed to be developed; in others the hybrid, or first cross, is
almost fertile; in others it is fertile, but produces depraved
issue.&nbsp; The result will vary with the capacities of the
creatures crossed, and the amount of conflict between their
several experiences.</p>
<p>The above view would remove all difficulties out of the way of
evolution, in so far as the sterility of hybrids is
concerned.&nbsp; For it would thus appear that this sterility has
nothing to do with any supposed immutable or fixed limits of
species, but results simply from the same principle which
prevents old friends, no matter how intimate in youth, from
returning to their old intimacy after a lapse of years, during
which they have been subjected to widely different influences,
inasmuch as they will each have contracted new habits, and have
got into new ways, which they do not like now to alter.</p>
<p>We should expect that our domesticated plants and animals
should vary most, inasmuch as these have been subjected to
changed conditions which would disturb the memory, and, breaking
the chain of recollection, through failure of some one or other
of the associated ideas, would thus directly and most markedly
affect the reproductive system.&nbsp; Every reader of Mr. Darwin
will know that this is what actually happens, and also that when
once a plant or animal begins to vary, it will probably vary a
good deal further; which, again, is what we should
expect&mdash;the disturbance of the memory introducing a fresh
factor of disturbance, which has to be dealt with by the
offspring as it best may.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin writes: &ldquo;All our
domesticated productions, with the rarest exceptions, vary far
more than natural species&rdquo; (&ldquo;Plants and
Animals,&rdquo; &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 241, ed. 1875).</p>
<p>On my third supposition, <i>i.e.</i>, when the difference
between parents has not been great enough to baffle reproduction
on the part of the first cross, but when the histories of the
father and mother have been, nevertheless, widely
different&mdash;as in the case of Europeans and Indians&mdash;we
should expect to have a race of offspring who should seem to be
quite clear only about those points, on which their progenitors
on both sides were in accord before the manifold divergencies in
their experiences commenced; that is to say, the offspring should
show a tendency to revert to an early savage condition.</p>
<p>That this indeed occurs may be seen from Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Plants and Animals under Domestication&rdquo; (vol. ii. p.
21, ed. 1875), where we find that travellers in all parts of the
world have frequently remarked &ldquo;<i>on the degraded state
and savage condition of crossed races of man</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
few lines lower down Mr. Darwin tells us that he was himself
&ldquo;struck with the fact that, in South America, men of
complicated descent between Negroes, Indians, and Spaniards
seldom had, whatever the cause might be, a good
expression.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Livingstone&rdquo; (continues Mr.
Darwin) &ldquo;remarks, &lsquo;It is unaccountable why
half-castes are so much more cruel than the Portuguese, but such
is undoubtedly the case.&rsquo;&nbsp; An inhabitant remarked to
Livingstone, &lsquo;God made white men, and God made black men,
but the devil made half-castes.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; A little
further on Mr. Darwin says that we may &ldquo;perhaps infer that
the degraded state of so many half-castes <i>is in part due to
reversion to a primitive and savage condition</i>, <i>induced by
the act of crossing</i>, even if mainly due to the unfavourable
moral conditions under which they are generally
reared.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why the crossing should produce this
particular tendency would seem to be intelligible enough, if the
fashion and instincts of offspring are, in any case, nothing but
the memories of its past existences; but it would hardly seem to
be so upon any of the theories now generally accepted; as,
indeed, is very readily admitted by Mr. Darwin himself, who even,
as regards purely-bred animals and plants, remarks that &ldquo;we
are quite unable to assign any proximate cause&rdquo; for their
tendency to at times reassume long lost characters.</p>
<p>If the reader will follow for himself the remaining phenomena
of reversion, he will, I believe, find them all explicable on the
theory that they are due to memory of past experiences fused, and
modified&mdash;at times specifically and definitely&mdash;by
changed conditions.&nbsp; There is, however, one apparently very
important phenomenon which I do not at this moment see how to
connect with memory, namely, the tendency on the part of
offspring to revert to an earlier impregnation.&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Provisional Theory of Pangenesis&rdquo;
seemed to afford a satisfactory explanation of this; but the
connection with memory was not immediately apparent.&nbsp; I
think it likely, however, that this difficulty will vanish on
further consideration, so I will not do more than call attention
to it here.</p>
<p>The instincts of certain neuter insects hardly bear upon
reversion, but will be dealt with at some length in Chapter
XII.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; We should expect to find, as was insisted on in the
preceding section in reference to the sterility of hybrids, that
it required many, or at any rate several, generations of changed
habits before a sufficiently deep impression could be made upon
the living being (who must be regarded always as one person in
his whole line of ascent or descent) for it to be unconsciously
remembered by him, when making himself anew in any succeeding
generation, and thus to make him modify his method of procedure
during his next embryological development.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we
should expect to find that sometimes a very deep single
impression made upon a living organism, should be remembered by
it, even when it is next in an embryonic condition.</p>
<p>That this is so, we find from Mr. Darwin, who writes
(&ldquo;Plants and Animals under Domestication,&rdquo; vol. ii.
p. 57, ed. 1875)&mdash;&ldquo;There is ample evidence that the
effect of mutilations and of accidents, especially, or perhaps
exclusively, when followed by disease&rdquo; (which would
certainly intensify the impression made), &ldquo;are occasionally
inherited.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the evil effects of
the long continued exposure of the parent to injurious conditions
are sometimes transmitted to the offspring.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
regards impressions of a less striking character, it is so
universally admitted that they are not observed to be repeated in
what is called the offspring, until they have been confirmed in
what is called the parent, for several generations, but that
after several generations, more or fewer as the case may be, they
often are transmitted&mdash;that it seems unnecessary to say more
upon the matter.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, the following passage
from Mr. Darwin may be admitted as conclusive:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they&rdquo; (acquired actions) &ldquo;are
inherited, we see with horses in certain transmitted paces, such
as cantering and ambling, which are not natural to them&mdash;in
the pointing of young pointers, and the setting of young
setters&mdash;in the peculiar manner of flight of certain breeds
of the pigeon, &amp;c.&nbsp; We have analogous cases with mankind
in the inheritance of tricks or unusual gestures.&rdquo; . . .
(&ldquo;Expression of the Emotions,&rdquo; p. 29).</p>
<p>In another place Mr. Darwin writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How again can we explain <i>the inherited effects</i>
of the use or disuse of particular organs?&nbsp; The domesticated
duck flies less and walks more than the wild duck, and its limb
bones have become diminished and increased in a corresponding
manner in comparison with those of the wild duck.&nbsp; A horse
is trained to certain paces, and the colt inherits similar
consensual movements.&nbsp; The domesticated rabbit becomes tame
from close confinement; the dog intelligent from associating with
man; the retriever is taught to fetch and carry; and these mental
endowments and bodily powers are all inherited&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Plants and Animals,&rdquo; &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 367, ed.
1875).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;in the whole
circuit of physiology is more wonderful.&nbsp; How can the use or
disuse of a particular limb, or of the brain, affect a small
aggregate of reproductive cells, seated in a distant part of the
body in such a manner that the being developed from these cells
inherits the character of one or both parents?&nbsp; Even an
imperfect answer to this question would be satisfactory&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Plants and Animals,&rdquo; &amp;c. vol. ii. p. 367, ed.
1875).</p>
<p>With such an imperfect answer will I attempt to satisfy the
reader, as to say that there appears to be that kind of
continuity of existence and sameness of personality, between
parents and offspring, which would lead us to expect that the
impressions made upon the parent should be epitomised in the
offspring, when they have been or have become important enough,
through repetition in the history of several so-called existences
to have earned a place in that smaller edition, which is issued
from generation to generation; or, in other words, when they have
been made so deeply, either at one blow or through many, that the
offspring can remember them.&nbsp; In practice we observe this to
be the case&mdash;so that the answer lies in the assertion that
offspring and parent, being in one sense but the same individual,
there is no great wonder that, in one sense, the first should
remember what had happened to the latter; and that too, much in
the same way as the individual remembers the events in the
earlier history of what he calls his own lifetime, but condensed,
and pruned of detail, and remembered as by one who has had a host
of other matters to attend to in the interim.</p>
<p>It is thus easy to understand why such a rite as circumcision,
though practised during many ages, should have produced little,
if any, modification tending to make circumcision
unnecessary.&nbsp; On the view here supported such modification
would be more surprising than not, for unless the impression made
upon the parent was of a grave character&mdash;and probably
unless also aggravated by subsequent confusion of memories in the
cells surrounding the part originally impressed&mdash;the parent
himself would not be sufficiently impressed to prevent him from
reproducing himself, as he had already done upon an infinite
number of past occasions.&nbsp; The child, therefore, in the womb
would do what the father in the womb had done before him, nor
should any trace of memory concerning circumcision be expected
till the eighth day after birth, when, but for the fact that the
impression in this case is forgotten almost as soon as made, some
slight presentiment of coming discomfort might, after a large
number of generations, perhaps be looked for as a general
rule.&nbsp; It would not, however, be surprising, that the effect
of circumcision should be occasionally inherited, and it would
appear as though this was sometimes actually the case.</p>
<p>The question should turn upon whether the disuse of an organ
has arisen:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From an internal desire on the part of the creature
disusing it, to be quit of an organ which it finds
troublesome.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; From changed conditions and habits which render the
organ no longer necessary, or which lead the creature to lay
greater stress on certain other organs or modifications.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; From the wish of others outside itself; the effect
produced in this case being perhaps neither very good nor very
bad for the individual, and resulting in no grave impression upon
the organism as a whole.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; From a single deep impression on a parent, affecting
both himself as a whole, and gravely confusing the memories of
the cells to be reproduced, or his memories in respect of those
cells&mdash;according as one adopts Pangenesis and supposes a
memory to &ldquo;run&rdquo; each gemmule, or as one supposes one
memory to &ldquo;run&rdquo; the whole impregnate ovum&mdash;a
compromise between these two views being nevertheless perhaps
possible, inasmuch as the combined memories of all the cells may
possibly <i>be</i> the memory which &ldquo;runs&rdquo; the
impregnate ovum, just as we <i>are</i> ourselves the combination
of all our cells, each one of which is both autonomous, and also
takes its share in the central government.&nbsp; But within the
limits of this volume it is absolutely impossible for me to go
into this question.</p>
<p>In the first case&mdash;under which some instances which
belong more strictly to the fourth would sometimes, but rarely,
come&mdash;the organ should soon go, and sooner or later leave no
rudiment, though still perhaps to be found crossing the life of
the embryo, and then disappearing.</p>
<p>In the second it should go more slowly, and leave, it may be,
a rudimentary structure.</p>
<p>In the third it should show little or no sign of natural
decrease for a very long time.</p>
<p>In the fourth there may be absolute and total sterility, or
sterility in regard to the particular organ, or a scar which
shall show that the memory of the wound and of each step in the
process of healing has been remembered; or there may be simply
such disturbance in the reproduced organ as shall show a confused
recollection of injury.&nbsp; There may be infinite gradations
between the first and last of these possibilities.</p>
<p>I think that the facts, as given by Mr. Darwin (&ldquo;Plants
and Animals,&rdquo; &amp;c., vol. i. pp. 466&ndash;472, ed.
1875), will bear out the above to the satisfaction of the
reader.&nbsp; I can, however, only quote the following
passage:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo; . . . Brown S&eacute;quard has bred during thirty
years many thousand guinea-pigs, . . . nor has he ever seen a
guinea-pig born without toes which was not the offspring of
parents <i>which had gnawed off their own toes</i>, owing to the
sciatic nerve having been divided.&nbsp; Of this fact thirteen
instances were carefully recorded, and a greater number were
seen; yet Brown S&eacute;quard speaks of such cases as among the
rarer forms of inheritance.&nbsp; It is a still more interesting
fact&mdash;&lsquo;that the sciatic nerve in the congenitally
toeless animal has inherited the power of passing through <i>all
the different morbid states</i> which have occurred in one of its
parents <i>from the time of division</i> till after its reunion
with the peripheric end.&nbsp; It is not therefore the power of
simply performing an action which is inherited, but the power of
performing a whole series of actions in a certain
order.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel inclined to say it is not merely the original wound
that is remembered, but the whole process of cure which is now
accordingly repeated.&nbsp; Brown S&eacute;quard concludes, as
Mr. Darwin tells us, &ldquo;that what is transmitted is the
morbid state of the nervous system,&rdquo; due to the operation
performed on the parents.</p>
<p>A little lower down Mr. Darwin writes that Professor Rolleston
has given him two cases&mdash;&ldquo;namely, of two men, one of
whom had his knee, and the other his cheek, severely cut, and
both had children born with exactly the same spot marked or
scarred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; When, however, an impression has once reached
transmission point&mdash;whether it be of the nature of a sudden
striking thought, which makes its mark deeply then and there, or
whether it be the result of smaller impressions repeated until
the nail, so to speak, has been driven home&mdash;we should
expect that it should be remembered by the offspring as something
which he has done all his life, and which he has therefore no
longer any occasion to learn; he will act, therefore, as people
say, <i>instinctively</i>.&nbsp; No matter how complex and
difficult the process, if the parents have done it sufficiently
often (that is to say, for a sufficient number of generations),
the offspring will remember the fact when association wakens the
memory; it will need no instruction, and&mdash;unless when it has
been taught to look for it during many generations&mdash;will
expect none.&nbsp; This may be seen in the case of the
humming-bird sphinx moth, which, as Mr. Darwin writes,
&ldquo;shortly after its emergence from the cocoon, as shown by
the bloom on its unruffled scales, may be seen poised stationary
in the air with its long hair-like proboscis uncurled, and
inserted into the minute orifices of flowers; <i>and no one I
believe has ever seen</i> this moth learning to perform its
difficult task, which requires such unerring aim&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Expression of the Emotions,&rdquo; p. 30).</p>
<p>And, indeed, when we consider that after a time the most
complex and difficult actions come to be performed by man without
the least effort or consciousness&mdash;that offspring cannot be
considered as anything but a continuation of the parent life,
whose past habits and experiences it epitomises when they have
been sufficiently often repeated to produce a lasting
impression&mdash;that consciousness of memory vanishes on the
memory&rsquo;s becoming intense, as completely as the
consciousness of complex and difficult movements vanishes as soon
as they have been sufficiently practised&mdash;and finally, that
the real presence of memory is testified rather by performance of
the repeated action on recurrence of like surroundings, than by
consciousness of recollecting on the part of the
individual&mdash;so that not only should there be no reasonable
bar to our attributing the whole range of the more complex
instinctive actions, from first to last, to memory pure and
simple, no matter how marvellous they may be, but rather that
there is so much to compel us to do so, that we find it difficult
to conceive how any other view can have been ever
taken&mdash;when, I say, we consider all these facts, we should
rather feel surprise that the hawk and sparrow still teach their
offspring to fly, than that the humming-bird sphinx moth should
need no teacher.</p>
<p>The phenomena, then, which we observe are exactly those which
we should expect to find.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; We should also expect that the memory of animals,
as regards their earlier existences, was solely stimulated by
association.&nbsp; For we find, from Prof. Bain, that
&ldquo;actions, sensations, and states of feeling occurring
together, or in close succession, tend to grow together or cohere
in such a way that when any one of them is afterwards presented
to the mind, the others are apt to be brought up in idea&rdquo;
(&ldquo;The Senses and the Intellect,&rdquo; 2d ed. 1864, p.
332).&nbsp; And Prof. Huxley says (&ldquo;Elementary Lessons in
Physiology,&rdquo; 5th ed. 1872, p. 306), &ldquo;It may be laid
down as a rule that if any two mental states be called up
together, or in succession, with due frequency and vividness, the
subsequent production of the one of them will suffice to call up
the other, <i>and that whether we desire it or
not</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I would go one step further, and would say
not only whether we desire it or not, but <i>whether we are aware
that the idea has ever before been called up in our minds or
not</i>.&nbsp; I should say that I have quoted both the above
passages from Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Expression of the
Emotions&rdquo; (p. 30, ed. 1872).</p>
<p>We should, therefore, expect that when the offspring found
itself in the presence of objects which had called up such and
such ideas for a sufficient number of generations, that is to
say, &ldquo;with due frequency and vividness&rdquo;&mdash;it
being of the same age as its parents were, and generally in like
case as when the ideas were called up in the minds of the
parents&mdash;the same ideas should also be called up in the
minds of the offspring &ldquo;<i>whether they desire it or
not</i>;&rdquo; and, I would say also, &ldquo;whether they
recognise the ideas as having ever before been present to them or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think we might also expect that no other force, save that of
association, should have power to kindle, so to speak, into the
flame of action the atomic spark of memory, which we can alone
suppose to be transmitted from one generation to another.</p>
<p>That both plants and animals do as we should expect of them in
this respect is plain, not only from the performance of the most
intricate and difficult actions&mdash;difficult both physically
and intellectually&mdash;at an age, and under circumstances which
preclude all possibility of what we call instruction, but from
the fact that deviations from the parental instinct, or rather
the recurrence of a memory, unless in connection with the
accustomed train of associations, is of comparatively rare
occurrence; the result, commonly, of some one of the many
memories about which we know no more than we do of the memory
which enables a cat to find her way home after a hundred-mile
journey by train, and shut up in a hamper, or, perhaps even more
commonly, of abnormal treatment.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; If, then, memory depends on association, we should
expect two corresponding phenomena in the case of plants and
animals&mdash;namely, that they should show a tendency to resume
feral habits on being turned wild after several generations of
domestication, and also that peculiarities should tend to show
themselves at a corresponding age in the offspring and in the
parents.&nbsp; As regards the tendency to resume feral habits,
Mr. Darwin, though apparently of opinion that the tendency to do
this has been much exaggerated, yet does not doubt that such a
tendency exists, as shown by well authenticated instances.&nbsp;
He writes: &ldquo;It has been repeatedly asserted in the most
positive manner by various authors that feral animals and plants
invariably return to their primitive specific type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This shows, at any rate, that there is a considerable opinion
to this effect among observers generally.</p>
<p>He continues: &ldquo;It is curious on what little evidence
this belief rests.&nbsp; Many of our domesticated animals could
not subsist in a wild state,&rdquo;&mdash;so that there is no
knowing whether they would or would not revert.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
several cases we do not know the aboriginal parent species, and
cannot tell whether or not there has been any close degree of
reversion.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that here, too, there is at any rate
no evidence <i>against</i> the tendency; the conclusion, however,
is that, notwithstanding the deficiency of positive evidence to
warrant the general belief as to the force of the tendency, yet
&ldquo;the simple fact of animals and plants becoming feral does
cause some tendency to revert to the primitive state,&rdquo; and
he tells us that &ldquo;when variously-coloured tame rabbits are
turned out in Europe, they generally re-acquire the colouring of
the wild animal;&rdquo; &ldquo;there can be no doubt,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;that this really does occur,&rdquo; though he seems
inclined to account for it by the fact that oddly-coloured and
conspicuous animals would suffer much from beasts of prey and
from being easily shot.&nbsp; &ldquo;The best known case of
reversion:&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;and that on which the
widely-spread belief in its universality apparently rests, is
that of pigs.&nbsp; These animals have run wild in the West
Indies, South America, and the Falkland Islands, and have
everywhere re-acquired the dark colour, the thick bristles, and
great tusks of the wild boar; and the young have re-acquired
longitudinal stripes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on page 22 of
&ldquo;Plants and Animals under Domestication&rdquo; (vol. ii.
ed. 1875) we find that &ldquo;the re-appearance of coloured,
longitudinal stripes on young feral pigs cannot be attributed to
the direct action of external conditions.&nbsp; In this case, and
in many others, we can only say that any change in the habits of
life apparently favours a tendency, inherent or latent, in the
species to return to the primitive state.&rdquo;&nbsp; On which
one cannot but remark that though any change may favour such
tendency, yet the return to original habits and surroundings
appears to do so in a way so marked as not to be readily
referable to any other cause than that of association and
memory&mdash;the creature, in fact, having got into its old
groove, remembers it, and takes to all its old ways.</p>
<p>As regards the tendency to inherit changes (whether embryonic,
or during post-natal development as ordinarily observed in any
species), or peculiarities of habit or form which do not partake
of the nature of disease, it must be sufficient to refer the
reader to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s remarks upon this subject
(&ldquo;Plants and Animals Under Domestication,&rdquo; vol. ii.
pp. 51&ndash;57, ed. 1875).&nbsp; The existence of the tendency
is not likely to be denied.&nbsp; The instances given by Mr.
Darwin are strictly to the point as regards all ordinary
developmental and metamorphic changes, and even as regards
transmitted acquired actions, and tricks acquired before the time
when the offspring has issued from the body of the parent, or on
an average of many generations does so; but it cannot for a
moment be supposed that the offspring knows by inheritance
anything about what happens to the parent subsequently to the
offspring&rsquo;s being born.&nbsp; Hence the appearance of
diseases in the offspring, at comparatively late periods in life,
but at the same age as, or earlier, than in the parents, must be
regarded as due to the fact that in each case the machine having
been made after the same pattern (which <i>is</i> due to memory),
is liable to have the same weak points, and to break down after a
similar amount of wear and tear; but after less wear and tear in
the case of the offspring than in that of the parent, because a
diseased organism is commonly a deteriorating organism, and if
repeated at all closely, and without repentance and amendment of
life, will be repeated for the worse.&nbsp; If we do not improve,
we grow worse.&nbsp; This, at least, is what we observe
daily.</p>
<p>Nor again can we believe, as some have fancifully imagined,
that the remembrance of any occurrence of which the effect has
been entirely, or almost entirely mental, should be remembered by
offspring with any definiteness.&nbsp; The intellect of the
offspring might be affected, for better or worse, by the general
nature of the intellectual employment of the parent; or a great
shock to a parent might destroy or weaken the intellect of the
offspring; but unless a deep impression were made upon the cells
of the body, and deepened by subsequent disease, we could not
expect it to be remembered with any definiteness, or
precision.&nbsp; We may talk as we will about mental pain, and
mental scars, but after all, the impressions they leave are
incomparably less durable than those made by an organic
lesion.&nbsp; It is probable, therefore, that the feeling which
so many have described, as though they remembered this or that in
some past existence, is purely imaginary, and due rather to
unconscious recognition of the fact that we certainly have lived
before, than to any actual occurrence corresponding to the
supposed recollection.</p>
<p>And lastly, we should look to find in the action of memory, as
between one generation and another, a reflection of the many
anomalies and exceptions to ordinary rules which we observe in
memory, so far as we can watch its action in what we call our own
single lives, and the single lives of others.&nbsp; We should
expect that reversion should be frequently capricious&mdash;that
is to say, give us more trouble to account for than we are either
able or willing to take.&nbsp; And assuredly we find it so in
fact.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin&mdash;from whom it is impossible to quote
too much or too fully, inasmuch as no one else can furnish such a
store of facts, so well arranged, and so above all suspicion of
either carelessness or want of candour&mdash;so that, however we
may differ from him, it is he himself who shows us how to do so,
and whose pupils we all are&mdash;Mr. Darwin writes: &ldquo;In
every living being we may rest assured that a host of long-lost
characters lie ready to be evolved under proper conditions&rdquo;
(does not one almost long to substitute the word
&ldquo;memories&rdquo; for the word
&ldquo;characters?&rdquo;)&nbsp; &ldquo;How can we make
intelligible, and connect with other facts, this wonderful and
common capacity of reversion&mdash;this power of calling back to
life long-lost characters?&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Plants and
Animals,&rdquo; &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 369, ed. 1875).&nbsp; Surely
the answer may be hazarded, that we shall be able to do so when
we can make intelligible the power of calling back to life
long-lost memories.&nbsp; But I grant that this answer holds out
no immediate prospect of a clear understanding.</p>
<p>One word more.&nbsp; Abundant facts are to be found which
point inevitably, as will appear more plainly in the following
chapter, in the direction of thinking that offspring inherits the
memories of its parents; but I know of no single fact which
suggests that parents are in the smallest degree affected (other
than sympathetically) by the memories of their offspring <i>after
that offspring has been born</i>.&nbsp; Whether the unborn
offspring affects the memory of the mother in some particulars,
and whether we have here the explanation of occasional reversion
to a previous impregnation, is a matter on which I should hardly
like to express an opinion now.&nbsp; Nor, again, can I find a
single fact which seems to indicate any memory of the parental
life on the part of offspring later than the average date of the
offspring&rsquo;s quitting the body of the parent.</p>
<h2><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">INSTINCT AS INHERITED MEMORY.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> already alluded to M.
Ribot&rsquo;s work on &ldquo;Heredity,&rdquo; from which I will
now take the following passages.</p>
<p>M. Ribot writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct is innate, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>anterior to all
individual experience</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This I deny on grounds
already abundantly apparent; but let it pass.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whereas intelligence is developed slowly by accumulated
experience, instinct is perfect from the first&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Heredity,&rdquo; p. 14).</p>
<p>Obviously the memory of a habit or experience will not
commonly be transmitted to offspring in that perfection which is
called &ldquo;instinct,&rdquo; till the habit or experience has
been repeated in several generations with more or less
uniformity; for otherwise the impression made will not be strong
enough to endure through the busy and difficult task of
reproduction.&nbsp; This of course involves that the habit shall
have attained, as it were equilibrium with the creature&rsquo;s
sense of its own needs, so that it shall have long seemed the
best course possible, leaving upon the whole and under ordinary
circumstances little further to be desired, and hence that it
should have been little varied during many generations.&nbsp; We
should expect that it would be transmitted in a more or less
partial, varying, imperfect, and intelligent condition before
equilibrium had been attained; it would, however, continually
tend towards equilibrium, for reasons which will appear more
fully later on.</p>
<p>When this stage has been reached, as regards any habit, the
creature will cease trying to improve; on which the repetition of
the habit will become stable, and hence become capable of more
unerring transmission&mdash;but at the same time improvement will
cease; the habit will become fixed, and be perhaps transmitted at
an earlier and earlier age, till it has reached that date of
manifestation which shall be found most agreeable to the other
habits of the creature.&nbsp; It will also be manifested, as a
matter of course, without further consciousness or reflection,
for people cannot be always opening up settled questions; if they
thought a matter over yesterday they cannot think it all over
again to-day, but will adopt for better or worse the conclusion
then reached; and this, too, even in spite sometimes of
considerable misgiving, that if they were to think still further
they could find a still better course.&nbsp; It is not,
therefore, to be expected that &ldquo;instinct&rdquo; should show
signs of that hesitating and tentative action which results from
knowledge that is still so imperfect as to be actively
self-conscious; nor yet that it should grow or vary, unless under
such changed conditions as shall baffle memory, and present the
alternative of either invention&mdash;that is to say,
variation&mdash;or death.&nbsp; But every instinct must have
poised through the laboriously intelligent stages through which
human civilisations <i>and mechanical inventions</i> are now
passing; and he who would study the origin of an instinct with
its development, partial transmission, further growth, further
transmission, approach to more unreflecting stability, and
finally, its perfection as an unerring and unerringly transmitted
instinct, must look to laws, customs, <i>and machinery</i> as his
best instructors.&nbsp; Customs and machines are instincts <i>and
organs</i> now in process of development; they will assuredly one
day reach the unconscious state of equilibrium which we observe
in the structures and instincts of bees and ants, and an approach
to which may be found among some savage nations.&nbsp; We may
reflect, however, not without pleasure, that this
condition&mdash;the true millennium&mdash;is still distant.&nbsp;
Nevertheless the ants and bees seem happy; perhaps more happy
than when so many social questions were in as hot discussion
among them, as other, and not dissimilar ones, will one day be
amongst ourselves.</p>
<p>And this, as will be apparent, opens up the whole question of
the stability of species, which we cannot follow further here,
than to say, that according to the balance of testimony, many
plants and animals do appear to have reached a phase of being
from which they are hard to move&mdash;that is to say, they will
die sooner than be at the pains of altering their
habits&mdash;true martyrs to their convictions.&nbsp; Such races
refuse to see changes in their surroundings as long as they can,
but when compelled to recognise them, they throw up the game
because they cannot and will not, or will not and cannot,
invent.&nbsp; And this is perfectly intelligible, for a race is
nothing but a long-lived individual, and like any individual, or
tribe of men whom we have yet observed, will have its special
capacities and its special limitations, though, as in the case of
the individual, so also with the race, it is exceedingly hard to
say what those limitations are, and why, having been able to go
so far, it should go no further.&nbsp; Every man and every race
is capable of education up to a certain point, but not to the
extent of being made from a sow&rsquo;s ear into a silk
purse.&nbsp; The proximate cause of the limitation seems to lie
in the absence of the wish to go further; the presence or absence
of the wish will depend upon the nature and surroundings of the
individual, which is simply a way of saying that one can get no
further, but that as the song (with a slight alteration)
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Some breeds do, and some breeds
don&rsquo;t,<br />
Some breeds will, but this breed won&rsquo;t,<br />
I tried very often to see if it would,<br />
But it said it really couldn&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t think it
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may perhaps be maintained, that with time and patience, one
might train a rather stupid plough-boy to understand the
differential calculus.&nbsp; This might be done with the help of
an inward desire on the part of the boy to learn, but never
otherwise.&nbsp; If the boy wants to learn or to improve
generally, he will do so in spite of every hindrance, till in
time he becomes a very different being from what he was
originally.&nbsp; If he does not want to learn, he will not do so
for any wish of another person.&nbsp; If he feels that he has the
power he will wish; or if he wishes, he will begin to think he
has the power, and try to fulfil his wishes; one cannot say which
comes first, for the power and the desire go always hand in hand,
or nearly so, and the whole business is nothing but a most
vicious circle from first to last.&nbsp; But it is plain that
there is more to be said on behalf of such circles than we have
been in the habit of thinking.&nbsp; Do what we will, we must
each one of us argue in a circle of our own, from which, so long
as we live at all, we can by no possibility escape.&nbsp; I am
not sure whether the frank acceptation and recognition of this
fact is not the best corrective for dogmatism that we are likely
to find.</p>
<p>We can understand that a pigeon might in the course of ages
grow to be a peacock if there was a persistent desire on the part
of the pigeon through all these ages to do so.&nbsp; We know very
well that this has not probably occurred in nature, inasmuch as
no pigeon is at all likely to wish to be very different from what
it is now.&nbsp; The idea of being anything very different from
what it now is, would be too wide a cross with the pigeon&rsquo;s
other ideas for it to entertain it seriously.&nbsp; If the pigeon
had never seen a peacock, it would not be able to conceive the
idea, so as to be able to make towards it; if, on the other hand,
it had seen one, it would not probably either want to become one,
or think that it would be any use wanting seriously, even though
it were to feel a passing fancy to be so gorgeously arrayed; it
would therefore lack that faith without which no action, and with
which, every action, is possible.</p>
<p>That creatures have conceived the idea of making themselves
like other creatures or objects which it was to their advantage
or pleasure to resemble, will be believed by any one who turns to
Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genesis of Species,&rdquo; where he
will find (chapter ii.) an account of some very showy South
American butterflies, which give out such a strong odour that
nothing will eat them, and which are hence mimicked both in
appearance and flight by a very different kind of butterfly; and,
again, we see that certain birds, without any particular desire
of gain, no sooner hear any sound than they begin to mimick it,
merely for the pleasure of mimicking; so we all enjoy to mimick,
or to hear good mimicry, so also monkeys imitate the actions
which they observe, from pure force of sympathy.&nbsp; To mimick,
or to wish to mimick, is doubtless often one of the first steps
towards varying in any given direction.&nbsp; Not less, in all
probability, than a full twenty per cent. of all the courage and
good nature now existing in the world, derives its origin, at no
very distant date, from a desire to appear courageous and
good-natured.&nbsp; And this suggests a work whose title should
be &ldquo;On the Fine Arts as bearing on the Reproductive
System,&rdquo; of which the title must suffice here.</p>
<p>Against faith, then, and desire, all the &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; in the world will not stop an am&oelig;ba from
becoming an elephant, if a reasonable time be granted; without
the faith and the desire, neither &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;
nor artificial breeding will be able to do much in the way of
modifying any structure.&nbsp; When we have once thoroughly
grasped the conception that we are all one creature, and that
each one of us is many millions of years old, so that all the
pigeons in the one line of an infinite number of generations are
still one pigeon only&mdash;then we can understand that a bird,
as different from a peacock as a pigeon is now, could yet have
wandered on and on, first this way and then that, doing what it
liked, and thought that it could do, till it found itself at
length a peacock; but we cannot believe either that a bird like a
pigeon should be able to apprehend any ideal so different from
itself as a peacock, and make towards it, or that man, having
wished to breed a bird anything like a peacock from a bird
anything like a pigeon, would be able to succeed in accumulating
accidental peacock-like variations till he had made the bird he
was in search of, no matter in what number of generations; much
less can we believe that the accumulation of small fortuitous
variations by &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; could succeed
better.&nbsp; We can no more believe the above, than we can
believe that a wish outside a plough-boy could turn him into a
senior wrangler.&nbsp; The boy would prove to be too many for his
teacher, and so would the pigeon for its breeder.</p>
<p>I do not forget that artificial breeding has modified the
original type of the horse and the dog, till it has at length
produced the dray-horse and the greyhound; but in each case man
has had to get use and disuse&mdash;that is to say, the desires
of the animal itself&mdash;to help him.</p>
<p>We are led, then, to the conclusion that all races have what
for practical purposes may be considered as their limits, though
there is no saying what those limits are, nor indeed why, in
theory, there should be any limits at all, but only that there
are limits in practice.&nbsp; Races which vary considerably must
be considered as clever, but it may be speculative, people who
commonly have a genius in some special direction, as perhaps for
mimicry, perhaps for beauty, perhaps for music, perhaps for the
higher mathematics, but seldom in more than one or two
directions; while &ldquo;inflexible organisations,&rdquo; like
that of the goose, may be considered as belonging to people with
one idea, and the greater tendency of plants and animals to vary
under domestication may be reasonably compared with the effects
of culture and education: that is to say, may be referred to
increased range and variety of experience or perceptions, which
will either cause sterility, if they be too unfamiliar, so as to
be incapable of fusion with preceding ideas, and hence to bring
memory to a sudden fault, or will open the door for all manner of
further variation&mdash;the new ideas having suggested new trains
of thought, which a clever example of a clever race will be only
too eager to pursue.</p>
<p>Let us now return to M. Ribot.&nbsp; He writes (p.
14):&mdash;&ldquo;The duckling hatched by the hen makes straight
for water.&rdquo;&nbsp; In what conceivable way can we account
for this, except on the supposition that the duckling knows
perfectly well what it can, and what it cannot do with water,
owing to its recollection of what it did when it was still one
individuality with its parents, and hence, when it was a duckling
before?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The squirrel, before it knows anything of winter, lays
up a store of nuts.&nbsp; A bird when hatched in a cage will,
when given its freedom, build for itself a nest like that of its
parents, out of the same materials, and of the same
shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this is not due to memory, even an imperfect explanation of
what else it can be due to, &ldquo;would be
satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intelligence gropes about, tries this way and that,
misses its object, commits mistakes, and corrects
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Because intelligence is of consciousness, and
consciousness is of attention, and attention is of uncertainty,
and uncertainty is of ignorance or want of consciousness.&nbsp;
Intelligence is not yet thoroughly up to its business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct advances with a mechanical
certainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why mechanical?&nbsp; Should not &ldquo;with apparent
certainty&rdquo; suffice?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence comes its unconscious character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for the word &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; this is true, and is
what we have been all along insisting on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It knows nothing either of ends, or of the means of
attaining them; it implies no comparison, judgment, or
choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is assumption.&nbsp; What is certain is that instinct
does not betray signs of self-consciousness as to its own
knowledge.&nbsp; It has dismissed reference to first principles,
and is no longer under the law, but under the grace of a settled
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All seems directed by thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes; because all <i>has been</i> in earlier existences
directed by thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without ever arriving at thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because it has <i>got past thought</i>, and though
&ldquo;directed by thought&rdquo; originally, is now travelling
in exactly the opposite direction.&nbsp; It is not likely to
reach thought again, till people get to know worse and worse how
to do things, the oftener they practise them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if this phenomenon appear strange, it must be
observed that analogous states occur in ourselves.&nbsp; <i>All
that we do from habit&mdash;walking</i>, <i>writing</i>, <i>or
practising a mechanical act</i>, <i>for instance&mdash;all these
and many other very complex acts are performed without
consciousness</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct appears stationary.&nbsp; It does not, like
intelligence, seem to grow and decay, to gain and to lose.&nbsp;
It does not improve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally.&nbsp; For improvement can only as a general rule be
looked for along the line of latest development, that is to say,
in matters concerning which the creature is being still
consciously exercised.&nbsp; Older questions are settled, and the
solution must be accepted as final, for the question of living at
all would be reduced to an absurdity, if everything decided upon
one day was to be undecided again the next; as with painting or
music, so with life and politics, let every man be fully
persuaded in his own mind, for decision with wrong will be
commonly a better policy than indecision&mdash;I had almost added
with right; and a firm purpose with risk will be better than an
infirm one with temporary exemption from disaster.&nbsp; Every
race has made its great blunders, to which it has nevertheless
adhered, inasmuch as the corresponding modification of other
structures and instincts was found preferable to the revolution
which would be caused by a radical change of structure, with
consequent havoc among a legion of vested interests.&nbsp;
Rudimentary organs are, as has been often said, the survivals of
these interests&mdash;the signs of their peaceful and gradual
extinction as living faiths; they are also instances of the
difficulty of breaking through any cant or trick which we have
long practised, and which is not sufficiently troublesome to make
it a serious object with us to cure ourselves of the habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it does not remain perfectly invariable, at least it
only varies within very narrow limits; and though this question
has been warmly debated in our day, and is yet unsettled, we may
yet say that in instinct immutability is the law, variation the
exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is quite as it should be.&nbsp; Genius will occasionally
rise a little above convention, but with an old convention
immutability will be the rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such,&rdquo; continues M. Ribot, &ldquo;are the
admitted characters of instinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes; but are they not also the admitted characters of actions
that are due to memory?</p>
<p>At the bottom of p. 15, M. Ribot quotes the following from Mr.
Darwin:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have reason to believe that aboriginal habits are
long retained under domestication.&nbsp; Thus with the common
ass, we see signs of its original desert-life in its strong
dislike to cross the smallest stream of water, and in its
pleasure in rolling in the dust.&nbsp; The same strong dislike to
cross a stream is common to the camel which has been domesticated
from a very early period.&nbsp; Young pigs, though so tame,
sometimes squat when frightened, and then try to conceal
themselves, even in an open and bare place.&nbsp; Young turkeys,
and occasionally even young fowls, when the hen gives the
danger-cry, run away and try to hide themselves, like young
partridges or pheasants, in order that their mother may take
flight, of which she has lost the power.&nbsp; The musk duck in
its native country often perches and roosts on trees, and our
domesticated musk ducks, though sluggish birds, are fond of
perching on the tops of barns, walls, &amp;c. . . .&nbsp; We know
that the dog, however well and regularly fed, often buries like
the fox any superfluous food; we see him turning round and round
on a carpet as if to trample down grass to form a bed. . . . In
the delight with which lambs and kids crowd together and frisk
upon the smallest hillock we see a vestige of their former alpine
habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What does this delightful passage go to show, if not that the
young in all these cases must still have a latent memory of their
past existences, which is called into an active condition as soon
as the associated ideas present themselves?</p>
<p>Returning to M. Ribot&rsquo;s own observations, we find he
tells us that it usually requires three or four generations to
fix the results of training, and to prevent a return to the
instincts of the wild state.&nbsp; I think, however, it would not
be presumptuous to suppose that if an animal after only three or
four generations of training be restored to its original
conditions of life, it will forget its intermediate training and
return to its old ways, almost as readily as a London street Arab
would forget the beneficial effects of a weeks training in a
reformatory school, if he were then turned loose again on the
streets.&nbsp; So if we hatch wild ducks&rsquo; eggs under a tame
duck, the ducklings &ldquo;will have scarce left the egg-shell
when they obey the instincts of their race and take their
flight.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the colts from wild horses, and mongrel
young between wild and domesticated horses, betray traces of
their earlier memories.</p>
<p>On this M. Ribot says: &ldquo;Originally man had considerable
trouble in taming the animals which are now domesticated; and his
work would have been in vain had not heredity&rdquo; (memory)
&ldquo;come to his aid.&nbsp; It may be said that after man has
modified a wild animal to his will, there goes on in its progeny
a silent conflict between two heredities&rdquo; (memories),
&ldquo;the one tending to fix the acquired modifications and the
other to preserve the primitive instincts.&nbsp; The latter often
get the mastery, and only after several generations is training
sure of victory.&nbsp; But we may see that in either case
heredity&rdquo; (memory) &ldquo;always asserts its
rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How marvellously is the above passage elucidated and made to
fit in with the results of our recognised experience, by the
simple substitution of the word &ldquo;memory&rdquo; for
&ldquo;heredity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the higher animals&rdquo;&mdash;to continue
quoting&mdash;&ldquo;which are possessed not only of instinct,
but also of intelligence, nothing is more common than to see
mental dispositions, which have evidently been acquired, so fixed
by heredity, that they are confounded with instinct, so
spontaneous and automatic do they become.&nbsp; Young pointers
have been known to point the first time they were taken out,
sometimes even better than dogs that had been for a long time in
training.&nbsp; The habit of saving life is hereditary in breeds
that have been brought up to it, as is also the shepherd
dog&rsquo;s habit of moving around the flock and guarding
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as we have grasped the notion, that instinct is only
the epitome of past experience, revised, corrected, made perfect,
and learnt by rote, we no longer find any desire to separate
&ldquo;instinct&rdquo; from &ldquo;mental dispositions, which
have evidently been acquired and fixed by heredity,&rdquo; for
the simple reason that they are one and the same thing.</p>
<p>A few more examples are all that my limits will
allow&mdash;they abound on every side, and the difficulty lies
only in selecting&mdash;M. Ribot being to hand, I will venture to
lay him under still further contributions.</p>
<p>On page 19 we find:&mdash;&ldquo;Knight has shown
experimentally the truth of the proverb, &lsquo;a good hound is
bred so,&rsquo; he took every care that when the pups were first
taken into the field, they should receive no guidance from older
dogs; yet the very first day, one of the pups stood trembling
with anxiety, having his eyes fixed and all his muscles strained
<i>at the partridges which their parents had been trained to
point</i>.&nbsp; A spaniel belonging to a breed which had been
trained to woodcock-shooting, knew perfectly well from the first
how to act like an old dog, avoiding places where the ground was
frozen, and where it was, therefore, useless to seek the game, as
there was no scent.&nbsp; Finally, a young polecat terrier was
thrown into a state of great excitement the first time he ever
saw one of these animals, while a spaniel remained perfectly
calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In South America, according to Roulin, dogs belonging
to a breed that has long been trained to the dangerous chase of
the peccary, when taken for the first time into the woods, know
the tactics to adopt quite as well as the old dogs, and that
without any instruction.&nbsp; Dogs of other races, and
unacquainted with the tactics, are killed at once, no matter how
strong they may be.&nbsp; The American greyhound, instead of
leaping at the stag, attacks him by the belly, and throws him
over, as his ancestors had been trained to do in hunting the
Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, then, heredity transmits modification no less
than natural instincts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should not this rather be&mdash;&ldquo;thus, then, we see that
not only older and remoter habits, but habits which have been
practised for a comparatively small number of generations, may be
so deeply impressed on the individual that they may dwell in his
memory, surviving the so-called change of personality which he
undergoes in each successive generation&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, however, an important difference to be noted:
the heredity of instincts admits of no exceptions, while in that
of modifications there are many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be well doubted how far the heredity of instincts
admits of no exceptions; on the contrary, it would seem probable
that in many races geniuses have from time to time arisen who
remembered not only their past experiences, as far as action and
habit went, but have been able to rise in some degree above habit
where they felt that improvement was possible, and who carried
such improvement into further practice, by slightly modifying
their structure in the desired direction on the next occasion
that they had a chance of dealing with protoplasm at all.&nbsp;
It is by these rare instances of intellectual genius (and I would
add of moral genius, if many of the instincts and structures of
plants and animals did not show that they had got into a region
as far above morals&mdash;other than enlightened
self-interest&mdash;as they are above articulate consciousness of
their own aims in many other respects)&mdash;it is by these
instances of either rare good luck or rare genius that many
species have been, in all probability, originated or
modified.&nbsp; Nevertheless inappreciable modification of
instinct is, and ought to be, the rule.</p>
<p>As to M. Ribot&rsquo;s assertion, that to the heredity of
modifications there are many exceptions, I readily agree with it,
and can only say that it is exactly what I should expect; the
lesson long since learnt by rote, and repeated in an infinite
number of generations, would be repeated unintelligently, and
with little or no difference, save from a rare accidental slip,
the effect of which would be the culling out of the bungler who
was guilty of it, or from the still rarer appearance of an
individual of real genius; while the newer lesson would be
repeated both with more hesitation and uncertainty, and with more
intelligence; and this is well conveyed in M. Ribot&rsquo;s next
sentence, for he says&mdash;&ldquo;It is only when variations
have been firmly rooted; when having become organic, they
constitute a second nature, which supplants the first; when, like
instinct, they have assumed a mechanical character, that they can
be transmitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How nearly M. Ribot comes to the opinion which I myself
venture to propound will appear from the following further
quotation.&nbsp; After dealing with somnambulism, and saying,
that if somnambulism were permanent and innate, it would be
impossible to distinguish it from instinct, he
continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence it is less difficult than is generally supposed,
to conceive how intelligence may become instinct; we might even
say that, leaving out of consideration the character of
innateness, to which we will return, we have seen the
metamorphosis take place.&nbsp; <i>There can then be no ground
for making instinct a faculty apart</i>, <i>sui generis</i>, a
phenomenon so mysterious, so strange, that usually no other
explanation of it is offered but that of attributing it to the
direct act of the Deity.&nbsp; This whole mistake is the result
of a defective psychology which makes no account of the
unconscious activity of the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are tempted to add&mdash;&ldquo;and which also makes no
account of the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> character of the continued
personality of successive generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are so accustomed,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;to contrast the characters of instinct with those of
intelligence&mdash;to say that instinct is innate, invariable,
automatic, while intelligence is something acquired, variable,
spontaneous&mdash;that it looks at first paradoxical to assert
that instinct and intelligence are identical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said that instinct is innate.&nbsp; But if, on
the one hand, we bear in mind that many instincts are acquired,
and that, according to a theory hereafter to be explained&rdquo;
(which theory, I frankly confess, I never was able to get hold
of), &ldquo;<i>all instincts are only hereditary
habits</i>&rdquo; (italics mine); &ldquo;if, on the other hand,
we observe that intelligence is in some sense held to be innate
by all modern schools of philosophy, which agree to reject the
theory of the <i>tabula rasa</i>&rdquo; (if there is no <i>tabula
rasa</i>, there is continued psychological personality, or words
have lost their meaning), &ldquo;and to accept either latent
ideas, or <i>&agrave; priori</i> forms of thought&rdquo; (surely
only a periphrasis for continued personality and memory)
&ldquo;or pre-ordination of the nervous system and of the
organism; <i>it will be seen that this character of innateness
does not constitute an absolute distinction between instinct and
intelligence</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that intelligence is variable, but so also
is instinct, as we have seen.&nbsp; In winter, the Rhine beaver
plasters his wall to windward; once he was a builder, now a
burrower; once he lived in society, now he is solitary.&nbsp;
Intelligence itself can scarcely be more variable . . . instinct
may be modified, lost, reawakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although intelligence is, as a rule, conscious, it may
also become unconscious and automatic, without losing its
identity.&nbsp; Neither is instinct always so blind, so
mechanical, as is supposed, for at times it is at fault.&nbsp;
The wasp that has faultily trimmed a leaf of its paper begins
again.&nbsp; The bee only gives the hexagonal form to its cell
after many attempts and alterations.&nbsp; It is difficult to
believe that the loftier instincts&rdquo; (and surely, then, the
more recent instincts) &ldquo;of the higher animals are not
accompanied <i>by at least a confused consciousness</i>.&nbsp;
There is, therefore, no absolute distinction between instinct and
intelligence; there is not a single characteristic which,
seriously considered, remains the exclusive property of
either.&nbsp; The contrast established between instinctive acts
and intellectual acts is, nevertheless, perfectly true, but only
when we compare the extremes.&nbsp; <i>As instinct rises it
approaches intelligence&mdash;as intelligence descends it
approaches instinct</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Ribot and myself (if I may venture to say so) are
continually on the verge of coming to an understanding, when, at
the very moment that we seem most likely to do so, we fly, as it
were, to opposite poles.&nbsp; Surely the passage last quoted
should be, &ldquo;As instinct falls,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, becomes
less and less certain of its ground, &ldquo;it approaches
intelligence; as intelligence rises,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, becomes
more and more convinced of the truth and expediency of its
convictions&mdash;&ldquo;it approaches instinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enough has been said to show that the opinions which I am
advancing are not new, but I have looked in vain for the
conclusions which, it appears to me, M. Ribot should draw from
his facts; throughout his interesting book I find the facts which
it would seem should have guided him to the conclusions, and
sometimes almost the conclusions themselves, but he never seems
quite to have reached them, nor has he arranged his facts so that
others are likely to deduce them, unless they had already arrived
at them by another road.&nbsp; I cannot, however, sufficiently
express my obligations to M. Ribot.</p>
<p>I cannot refrain from bringing forward a few more instances of
what I think must be considered by every reader as hereditary
memory.&nbsp; Sydney Smith writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir James Hall hatched some chickens in an oven.&nbsp;
Within a few minutes after the shell was broken, a spider was
turned loose before this very youthful brood; the destroyer of
flies had hardly proceeded more than a few inches, before he was
descried by one of these oven-born chickens, and, at one peck of
his bill, immediately devoured.&nbsp; This certainly was not
imitation.&nbsp; A female goat very near delivery died; Galen cut
out the young kid, and placed before it a bundle of hay, a bunch
of fruit, and a pan of milk; the young kid smelt to them all very
attentively, and then began to lap the milk.&nbsp; This was not
imitation.&nbsp; And what is commonly and rightly called
instinct, cannot be explained away, under the notion of its being
imitation&rdquo; (Lecture xvii. on Moral Philosophy).</p>
<p>It cannot, indeed, be explained away under the notion of its
being imitation, but I think it may well be so under that of its
being memory.</p>
<p>Again, a little further on in the same lecture, as that above
quoted from, we find:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ants and beavers lay up magazines.&nbsp; Where do they
get their knowledge that it will not be so easy to collect food
in rainy weather, as it is in summer?&nbsp; Men and women know
these things, because their grandpapas and grandmammas have told
them so.&nbsp; Ants hatched from the egg artificially, or birds
hatched in this manner, have all this knowledge by intuition,
without the smallest communication with any of their
relations.&nbsp; Now observe what the solitary wasp does; she
digs several holes in the sand, in each of which she deposits an
egg, though she certainly knows not (?) that an animal is
deposited in that egg, and still less that this animal must be
nourished with other animals.&nbsp; She collects a few green
flies, rolls them up neatly in several parcels (like Bologna
sausages), and stuffs one parcel into each hole where an egg is
deposited.&nbsp; When the wasp worm is hatched, it finds a store
of provision ready made; and what is most curious, the quantity
allotted to each is exactly sufficient to support it, till it
attains the period of wasphood, and can provide for itself.&nbsp;
This instinct of the parent wasp is the more remarkable as it
does not feed upon flesh itself.&nbsp; Here the little creature
has never seen its parent; for by the time it is born, the parent
is always eaten by sparrows; and yet, without the slightest
education, or previous experience, it does everything that the
parent did before it.&nbsp; Now the objectors to the doctrine of
instinct may say what they please, but young tailors have no
intuitive method of making pantaloons; a new-born mercer cannot
measure diaper; nature teaches a cook&rsquo;s daughter nothing
about sippets.&nbsp; All these things require with us seven
years&rsquo; apprenticeship; but insects are like
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s persons of quality&mdash;they know
everything (as Moli&egrave;re says), without having learnt
anything.&nbsp; &lsquo;Les gens de qualit&eacute; savent tout,
sans avoir rien appris.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>How completely all difficulty vanishes from the facts so
pleasantly told in this passage when we bear in mind the true
nature of personal identity, the ordinary working of memory, and
the vanishing tendency of consciousness concerning what we know
exceedingly well.</p>
<p>My last instance I take from M. Ribot, who
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Gratiolet, in his <i>Anatomie
Compar&egrave;e du Syst&egrave;me Nerveux</i>, states that an old
piece of wolf&rsquo;s skin, with the hair all worn away, when set
before a little dog, threw the animal into convulsions of fear by
the slight scent attaching to it.&nbsp; The dog had never seen a
wolf, and we can only explain this alarm by the hereditary
transmission of certain sentiments, coupled with a certain
perception of the sense of smell&rdquo; (&ldquo;Heredity,&rdquo;
p. 43).</p>
<p>I should prefer to say &ldquo;we can only explain the alarm by
supposing that the smell of the wolf&rsquo;s
skin&rdquo;&mdash;the sense of smell being, as we all know, more
powerful to recall the ideas that have been associated with it
than any other sense&mdash;&ldquo;brought up the ideas with which
it had been associated in the dog&rsquo;s mind during many
previous existences&rdquo;&mdash;he on smelling the wolf&rsquo;s
skin remembering all about wolves perfectly well.</p>

220</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">INSTINCTS OF NEUTER INSECTS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter I will consider, as
briefly as possible, the strongest argument that I have been able
to discover against the supposition that instinct is chiefly due
to habit.&nbsp; I have said &ldquo;the strongest argument;&rdquo;
I should have said, the only argument that struck me as offering
on the face of it serious difficulties.</p>
<p>Turning, then, to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s chapter on instinct
(&ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; ed. 1876, p. 205), we find
substantially much the same views as those taken at a later date
by M. Ribot, and referred to in the preceding chapter.&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An action, which we ourselves require experience to
enable us to perform, when performed by an animal, more
especially a very young one, without experience, and when
performed by many animals in the same way without their knowing
for what purpose it is performed, is usually said to be
instinctive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above should strictly be, &ldquo;without their being
conscious of their own knowledge concerning the purpose for which
they act as they do;&rdquo; and though some may say that the two
phrases come to the same thing, I think there is an important
difference, as what I propose distinguishes ignorance from
over-familiarity, both which states are alike unself-conscious,
though with widely different results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I could show,&rdquo; continues Mr. Darwin,
&ldquo;that none of these characters are universal.&nbsp; A
little dose of judgement or reason, as Pierre Huber expresses it,
often comes into play even with animals low in the scale of
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frederick Cuvier and several of the older
metaphysicians have compared instinct with habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would go further and would say, that instinct, in the great
majority of cases, is habit pure and simple, contracted
originally by some one or more individuals; practised, probably,
in a consciously intelligent manner during many successive lives,
until the habit has acquired the highest perfection which the
circumstances admitted; and, finally, so deeply impressed upon
the memory as to survive that effacement of minor impressions
which generally takes place in every fresh life-wave or
generation.</p>
<p>I would say, that unless the identity of offspring with their
parents be so far admitted that the children be allowed to
remember the deeper impressions engraved on the minds of those
who begot them, it is little less than trilling to talk, as so
many writers do, about inherited habit, or the experience of the
race, or, indeed, accumulated variations of instincts.</p>
<p>When an instinct is not habit, as resulting from memory pure
and simple, it is habit modified by some treatment, generally in
the youth or embryonic stages of the individual, which disturbs
his memory, and drives him on to some unusual course, inasmuch as
he cannot recognise and remember his usual one by reason of the
change now made in it.&nbsp; Habits and instincts, again, may be
modified by any important change in the condition of the parents,
which will then both affect the parent&rsquo;s sense of his own
identity, and also create more or less fault, or dislocation of
memory, in the offspring immediately behind the memory of his
last life.&nbsp; Change of food may at times be sufficient to
create a specific modification&mdash;that is to say, to affect
all the individuals whose food is so changed, in one and the same
way&mdash;whether as regards structure or habit.&nbsp; Thus we
see that certain changes in food (and domicile), from those with
which its ancestors have been familiar, will disturb the memory
of a queen bee&rsquo;s egg, and set it at such disadvantage as to
make it make itself into a neuter bee; but yet we find that the
larva thus partly aborted may have its memories restored to it,
if not already too much disturbed, and may thus return to its
condition as a queen bee, if it only again be restored to the
food and domicile, which its past memories can alone
remember.</p>
<p>So we see that opium, tobacco, alcohol, hasheesh, and tea
produce certain effects upon our own structure and
instincts.&nbsp; But though capable of modification, and of
specific modification, which may in time become inherited, and
hence resolve itself into a true instinct or settled question,
yet I maintain that the main bulk of the instinct (whether as
affecting structure or habits of life) will be derived from
memory pure and simple; the individual growing up in the shape he
does, and liking to do this or that when he is grown up, simply
from recollection of what he did last time, and of what on the
whole suited him.</p>
<p>For it must be remembered that a drug which should destroy
some one part at an early embryonic stage, and thus prevent it
from development, would prevent the creature from recognising the
surroundings which affected that part when he was last alive and
unmutilated, as being the same as his present surroundings.&nbsp;
He would be puzzled, for he would be viewing the position from a
different standpoint.&nbsp; If any important item in a number of
associated ideas disappears, the plot fails; and a great internal
change is an exceedingly important item.&nbsp; Life and things to
a creature so treated at an early embryonic stage would not be
life and things as he last remembered them; hence he would not be
able to do the same now as he did then; that is to say, he would
vary both in structure and instinct; but if the creature were
tolerably uniform to start with, and were treated in a tolerably
uniform way, we might expect the effect produced to be much the
same in all ordinary cases.</p>
<p>We see, also, that any important change in treatment and
surroundings, if not sufficient to kill, would and does tend to
produce not only variability but sterility, as part of the same
story and for the same reason&mdash;namely, default of memory;
this default will be of every degree of intensity, from total
failure, to a slight disturbance of memory as affecting some one
particular organ only; that is to say, from total sterility, to a
slight variation in an unimportant part.&nbsp; So that even
<i>the slightest conceivable variations should be referred to
changed conditions</i>, <i>external or internal</i>, <i>and to
their disturbing effects upon the memory</i>; and sterility,
without any apparent disease of the reproductive system, may be
referred not so much to special delicacy or susceptibility of the
organs of reproduction as to inability on the part of the
creature to know where it is, and to recognise itself as the same
creature which it has been accustomed to reproduce.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin thinks that the comparison of habit with instinct
gives &ldquo;an accurate notion of the frame of mind under which
an instinctive action is performed, but not,&rdquo; he thinks,
&ldquo;of its origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unconsciously,&rdquo; Mr. Darwin continues,
&ldquo;many habitual actions are performed, indeed not rarely in
direct opposition to our conscious will!&nbsp; Yet they may be
modified by the will or by reason.&nbsp; Habits easily become
associated with other habits, with certain periods of time and
states of body.&nbsp; When once acquired, they often remain
constant throughout life.&nbsp; Several other points of
resemblance between instincts and habits could be pointed
out.&nbsp; As in repeating a well-known song, so in instincts,
one action follows another by a sort of rhythm.&nbsp; If a person
be interrupted in a song or in repeating anything by rote, he is
generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of
thought; so P. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes
a very complicated hammock.&nbsp; For if he took a caterpillar
which had completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage of
construction, and put it into a hammock completed up only to the
third stage, the caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth,
fifth, and sixth stages of construction.&nbsp; If, however, a
caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to
the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth
stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from
deriving any benefit from this, it was much embarrassed, and in
order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the
third stage, where it had left off, and thus tried to complete
the already finished work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see I must have unconsciously taken my first chapter from
this passage, but it is immaterial.&nbsp; I owe Mr. Darwin much
more than this.&nbsp; I owe it to him that I believe in evolution
at all.&nbsp; I owe him for almost all the facts which have led
me to differ from him, and which I feel absolutely safe in taking
for granted, if he has advanced them.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I
believe that the conclusion arrived at in the passage which I
will next quote is a mistaken one, and that not a little only,
but fundamentally.&nbsp; I shall therefore venture to dispute
it.</p>
<p>The passage runs:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we suppose any habitual action to become
inherited&mdash;and it can be shown that this does sometimes
happen&mdash;then the resemblance between what originally was a
habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be
distinguished. . . . <i>But it would be a serious error to
suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired
by habit in one generation</i>, <i>and then transmitted by
inheritance to succeeding generations</i>.&nbsp; <i>It can be
clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are
acquainted&mdash;namely</i>, <i>those of the hive-bee and of many
ants</i>, <i>could not possibly have been acquired by
habit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; p. 206,
ed. 1876.)&nbsp; The italics in this passage are mine.</p>
<p>No difficulty is opposed to my view (as I call it, for the
sake of brevity) by such an instinct as that of ants to milk
aphids.&nbsp; Such instincts may be supposed to have been
acquired in much the same way as the instinct of a farmer to keep
a cow.&nbsp; Accidental discovery of the fact that the excretion
was good, with &ldquo;a little dose of judgement or reason&rdquo;
from time to time appearing in an exceptionally clever ant, and
by him communicated to his fellows, till the habit was so
confirmed as to be capable of transmission in full
unself-consciousness (if indeed the instinct be unself-conscious
in this case), would, I think, explain this as readily as the
slow and gradual accumulations of instincts which had never
passed through the intelligent and self-conscious stage, but had
always prompted action without any idea of a why or a wherefore
on the part of the creature itself.</p>
<p>For it must be remembered, as I am afraid I have already
perhaps too often said, that even when we have got a slight
variation of instinct, due to some cause which we know nothing
about, but which I will not even for a moment call
&ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo;&mdash;a word that should be cut out of
every dictionary, or in some way branded as perhaps the most
misleading in the language&mdash;we cannot see how it comes to be
repeated in successive generations, so as to be capable of being
acted upon by &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; and accumulated,
unless it be also capable of being remembered by the offspring of
the varying creature.&nbsp; It may be answered that we cannot
know anything about this, but that &ldquo;like father like
son&rdquo; is an ultimate fact in nature.&nbsp; I can only answer
that I never observe any &ldquo;like father like son&rdquo;
without the son&rsquo;s both having had every opportunity of
remembering, and showing every symptom of having remembered, in
which case I decline to go further than memory (whatever memory
may be) as the cause of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>But besides inheritance, teaching must be admitted as a means
of at any rate modifying an instinct.&nbsp; We observe this in
our own case; and we know that animals have great powers of
communicating their ideas to one another, though their manner of
doing this is as incomprehensible by us as a plant&rsquo;s
knowledge of chemistry, or the manner in which an am&oelig;ba
makes its test, or a spider its web, without having gone through
a long course of mathematics.&nbsp; I think most readers will
allow that our early training and the theological systems of the
last eighteen hundred years are likely to have made us
involuntarily under-estimate the powers of animals low in the
scale of life, both as regards intelligence and the power of
communicating their ideas to one another; but even now we admit
that ants have great powers in this respect.</p>
<p>A habit, however, which is taught to the young or each
successive generation, by older members of the community who have
themselves received it by instruction, should surely rank as an
inherited habit, and be considered as due to memory, though
personal teaching be necessary to complete the inheritance.</p>
<p>An objection suggests itself that if such a habit as the
flight of birds, which seems to require a little personal
supervision and instruction before it is acquired perfectly, were
really due to memory, the need of instruction would after a time
cease, inasmuch as the creature would remember its past method of
procedure, and would thus come to need no more teaching.&nbsp;
The answer lies in the fact, that if a creature gets to depend
upon teaching and personal help for any matter, its memory will
make it look for such help on each repetition of the action; so
we see that no man&rsquo;s memory will exert itself much until he
is thrown upon memory as his only resource.&nbsp; We may read a
page of a book a hundred times, but we do not remember it by
heart unless we have either cultivated our powers of learning to
repeat, or have taken pains to learn this particular page.</p>
<p>And whether we read from a book, or whether we repeat by
heart, the repetition is still due to memory; only in the one
case the memory is exerted to recall something which one saw only
half a second ago, and in the other, to recall something not seen
for a much longer period.&nbsp; So I imagine an instinct or habit
may be called an inherited habit, and assigned to memory, even
though the memory dates, not from the performance of the action
by the learner when he was actually part of the personality of
the teacher, but rather from a performance witnessed by, or
explained by the teacher to, the pupil at a period subsequent to
birth.&nbsp; In either case the habit is inherited in the sense
of being acquired in one generation, and transmitted with such
modifications as genius and experience may have suggested.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin would probably admit this without hesitation; when,
therefore, he says that certain instincts could not possibly have
been acquired by habit, he must mean that they could not, under
the circumstances, have been remembered by the pupil in the
person of the teacher, and that it would be a serious error to
suppose that the greater number of instincts can be thus
remembered.&nbsp; To which I assent readily so far as that it is
difficult (though not impossible) to see how some of the most
wonderful instincts of neuter ants and bees can be due to the
fact that the neuter ant or bee was ever in part, or in some
respects, another neuter ant or bee in a previous
generation.&nbsp; At the same time I maintain that this does not
militate against the supposition that both instinct and structure
are in the main due to memory.&nbsp; For the power of receiving
any communication, and acting on it, is due to memory; and the
neuter ant or bee may have received its lesson from another
neuter ant or bee, who had it from another and modified it; and
so back and back, till the foundation of the habit is reached,
and is found to present little more than the faintest family
likeness to its more complex descendant.&nbsp; Surely Mr. Darwin
cannot mean that it can be shewn that the wonderful instincts of
neuter ants and bees cannot have been acquired either, as above,
by instruction, or by some not immediately obvious form of
inherited transmission, but that they must be due to the fact
that the ant or bee is, as it were, such and such a machine, of
which if you touch such and such a spring, you will get a
corresponding action.&nbsp; If he does, he will find, so far as I
can see, no escape from a position very similar to the one which
I put into the mouth of the first of the two professors, who
dealt with the question of machinery in my earlier work,
&ldquo;Erewhon,&rdquo; and which I have since found that my great
namesake made fun of in the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">. . . &ldquo;They now begun<br />
To spur their living engines on.<br />
For as whipped tops and bandy&rsquo;d balls,<br />
The learned hold are animals:<br />
So horses they affirm to be<br />
Mere engines made by geometry,<br />
And were invented first from engines<br />
As Indian Britons were from Penguins.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"
class="poetry">&mdash;<i>Hudibras</i>, Canto ii. line 53,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>I can see, then, no difficulty in the development of the
ordinary so-called instincts, whether of ants or bees, or the
cuckoo, or any other animal, on the supposition that they were,
for the most part, intelligently acquired with more or less
labour, as the case may be, in much the same way as we see any
art or science now in process of acquisition among ourselves, but
were ultimately remembered by offspring, or communicated to
it.&nbsp; When the limits of the race&rsquo;s capacity had been
attained (and most races seem to have their limits,
unsatisfactory though the expression may very fairly be
considered), or when the creature had got into a condition, so to
speak, of equilibrium with its surroundings, there would be no
new development of instincts, and the old ones would cease to be
improved, inasmuch as there would be no more reasoning or
difference of opinion concerning them.&nbsp; The race, therefore,
or species would remain in <i>statu quo</i> till either
domesticated, and so brought into contact with new ideas and
placed in changed conditions, or put under such pressure, in a
wild state, as should force it to further invention, or
extinguish it if incapable of rising to the occasion.&nbsp; That
instinct and structure may be acquired by practice in one or more
generations, and remembered in succeeding ones, is admitted by
Mr. Darwin, for he allows (&ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; p.
206) that habitual action does sometimes become inherited, and,
though he does not seem to conceive of such action as due to
memory, yet it is inconceivable how it is inherited, if not as
the result of memory.</p>
<p>It must be admitted, however, that when we come to consider
the structures as well as the instincts of some of the neuter
insects, our difficulties seem greatly increased.&nbsp; The
neuter hive-bees have a cavity in their thighs in which to keep
the wax, which it is their business to collect; but the drones
and queen, which alone bear offspring, collect no wax, and
therefore neither want, nor have, any such cavity.&nbsp; The
neuter bees are also, if I understand rightly, furnished with a
proboscis or trunk for extracting honey from flowers, whereas the
fertile bees, who gather no honey, have no such proboscis.&nbsp;
Imagine, if the reader will, that the neuter bees differ still
more widely from the fertile ones; how, then, can they in any
sense be said to derive organs from their parents, which not one
of their parents for millions of generations has ever had?&nbsp;
How, again, can it be supposed that they transmit these organs to
the future neuter members of the community when they are
perfectly sterile?</p>
<p>One can understand that the young neuter bee might be taught
to make a hexagonal cell (though I have not found that any one
has seen the lesson being given) inasmuch as it does not make the
cell till after birth, and till after it has seen other neuter
bees who might tell it much in, <i>qu&acirc;</i> us, a very
little time; but we can hardly understand its growing a proboscis
before it could possibly want it, or preparing a cavity in its
thigh, to have it ready to put wax into, when none of its
predecessors had ever done so, by supposing oral communication,
during the larvahood.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it must not be
forgotten that bees seem to know secrets about reproduction,
which utterly baffle ourselves; for example, the queen bee
appears to know how to deposit male or female, eggs at will; and
this is a matter of almost inconceivable sociological importance,
denoting a corresponding amount of sociological and physiological
knowledge generally.&nbsp; It should not, then, surprise us if
the race should possess other secrets, whose working we are
unable to follow, or even detect at all.</p>
<p>Sydney Smith, indeed, writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The warmest admirers of honey, and the greatest friends
to bees, will never, I presume, contend that the young swarm, who
begin making honey three or four months after they are born, and
immediately construct these mathematical cells, should have
gained their geometrical knowledge as we gain ours, and in three
months&rsquo; time outstrip Mr. Maclaurin in mathematics as much
as they did in making honey.&nbsp; It would take a senior
wrangler at Cambridge ten hours a day for three years together to
know enough mathematics for the calculation of these problems,
with which not only every queen bee, but every undergraduate
grub, is acquainted the moment it is born.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last
statement may be a little too strong, but it will at once occur
to the reader, that as we know the bees <i>do</i> surpass Mr.
Maclaurin in the power of making honey, they may also surpass him
in capacity for those branches of mathematics with which it has
been their business to be conversant during many millions of
years, and also in knowledge of physiology and psychology in so
far as the knowledge bears upon the interests of their own
community.</p>
<p>We know that the larva which develops into a neuter bee, and
that again which in time becomes a queen bee, are the same kind
of larva to start with; and that if you give one of these
larv&aelig; the food and treatment which all its foremothers have
been accustomed to, it will turn out with all the structure and
instincts of its foremothers&mdash;and that it only fails to do
this because it has been fed, and otherwise treated, in such a
manner as not one of its foremothers was ever yet fed or
treated.&nbsp; So far, this is exactly what we should expect, on
the view that structure and instinct are alike mainly due to
memory, or to medicined memory.&nbsp; Give the larva a fair
chance of knowing where it is, and it shows that it remembers by
doing exactly what it did before.&nbsp; Give it a different kind
of food and house, and it cannot be expected to be anything else
than puzzled.&nbsp; It remembers a great deal.&nbsp; It comes out
a bee, and nothing but a bee; but it is an aborted bee; it is, in
fact, mutilated before birth instead of after&mdash;with
instinct, as well as growth, correlated to its abortion, as we
see happens frequently in the case of animals a good deal higher
than bees that have been mutilated at a stage much later than
that at which the abortion of neuter bees commences.</p>
<p>The larv&aelig; being similar to start with, and being
similarly mutilated&mdash;i.e., by change of food and dwelling,
will naturally exhibit much similarity of instinct and structure
on arriving at maturity.&nbsp; When driven from their usual
course, they must take <i>some</i> new course or die.&nbsp; There
is nothing strange in the fact that similar beings puzzled
similarly should take a similar line of action.&nbsp; I grant,
however, that it is hard to see how change of food and treatment
can puzzle an insect into such &ldquo;complex growth&rdquo; as
that it should make a cavity in its thigh, grow an invaluable
proboscis, and betray a practical knowledge of difficult
mathematical problems.</p>
<p>But it must be remembered that the memory of having been queen
bees and drones&mdash;which is all that according to my
supposition the larv&aelig; can remember, (on a first view of the
case), in their own proper persons&mdash;would nevertheless carry
with it a potential recollection of all the social arrangements
of the hive.&nbsp; They would thus potentially remember that the
mass of the bees were always neuter bees; they would remember
potentially the habits of these bees, so far as drones and queens
know anything about them; and this may be supposed to be a very
thorough acquaintance; in like manner, and with the same
limitation, they would know from the very moment that they left
the queen&rsquo;s body that neuter bees had a proboscis to gather
honey with, and cavities in their thighs to put wax into, and
that cells were to be made with certain angles&mdash;for surely
it is not crediting the queen with more knowledge than she is
likely to possess, if we suppose her to have a fair acquaintance
with the phenomena of wax and cells generally, even though she
does not make any; they would know (while still
larv&aelig;&mdash;and earlier) the kind of cells into which
neuter bees were commonly put, and the kind of treatment they
commonly received&mdash;they might therefore, as
eggs&mdash;immediately on finding their recollection driven from
its usual course, so that they must either find some other
course, or die&mdash;know that they were being treated as neuter
bees are treated, and that they were expected to develop into
neuter bees accordingly; they might know all this, and a great
deal more into the bargain, inasmuch as even before being
actually deposited as eggs they would know and remember
potentially, but unconsciously, all that their parents knew and
remembered intensely.&nbsp; Is it, then, astonishing that they
should adapt themselves so readily to the position which they
know it is for the social welfare of the community, and hence of
themselves, that they should occupy, and that they should know
that they will want a cavity in their thighs and a proboscis, and
hence make such implements out of their protoplasm as readily as
they make their wings?</p>
<p>I admit that, under normal treatment, none of the
above-mentioned potential memories would be kindled into such a
state of activity that action would follow upon them, until the
creature had attained a more or less similar condition to that in
which its parent was when these memories were active within its
mind: but the essence of the matter is, that these larv&aelig;
have been treated <i>abnormally</i>, so that if they do not die,
there is nothing for it but that they must vary.&nbsp; One cannot
argue from the normal to the abnormal.&nbsp; It would not, then,
be strange if the potential memories should (owing to the margin
for premature or tardy development which association admits)
serve to give the puzzled larv&aelig; a hint as to the course
which they had better take, or that, at any rate, it should
greatly supplement the instruction of the &ldquo;nurse&rdquo;
bees themselves by rendering the larv&aelig; so, as it were,
inflammable on this point, that a spark should set them in a
blaze.&nbsp; Abortion is generally premature.&nbsp; Thus the
scars referred to in the last chapter as having appeared on the
children of men who had been correspondingly wounded, should not,
under normal circumstances, have appeared in the offspring till
the children had got fairly near the same condition generally as
that in which their fathers were when they were wounded, and even
then, normally, there should have been an instrument to wound
them, much as their fathers had been wounded.&nbsp; Association,
however, does not always stick to the letter of its bond.</p>
<p>The line, again, might certainly be taken that the difference
in structure and instincts between neuter and fertile bees is due
to the specific effects of certain food and treatment; yet,
though one would be sorry to set limits to the convertibility of
food and genius, it seems hard to believe that there can be any
untutored food which should teach a bee to make a hexagonal cell
as soon as it was born, or which, before it was born, should
teach it to prepare such structures as it would require in after
life.&nbsp; If, then, food be considered as a direct agent in
causing the structures and instinct, and not an indirect agent,
merely indicating to the larva itself that it is to make itself
after the fashion of neuter bees, then we should bear in mind
that, at any rate, it has been leavened and prepared in the
stomachs of those neuter bees into which the larva is now
expected to develop itself, and may thus have in it more true
germinative matter&mdash;gemmules, in fact&mdash;than is commonly
supposed.&nbsp; Food, when sufficiently assimilated (the whole
question turning upon what <i>is</i> &ldquo;sufficiently&rdquo;),
becomes stored with all the experience and memories of the
assimilating creature; corn becomes hen, and knows nothing but
hen, when hen has eaten it.&nbsp; We know also that the neuter
working-bees inject matter into the cell after the larva has been
produced; nor would it seem harsh to suppose that though devoid
of a reproductive system like that of their parents, they may yet
be practically not so neuter as is commonly believed.&nbsp; One
cannot say what gemmules of thigh and proboscis may not have got
into the neutral bees&rsquo; stomachs, if they assimilate their
food sufficiently, and thus into the larva.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin will be the first to admit that though a creature
have no reproductive system, in any ordinary sense of the word,
yet every unit or cell of its body may throw off gemmules which
may be free to move over every part of the whole organism, and
which &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; might in time cause to
stray into food which had been sufficiently prepared in the
stomachs of the neuter bees.</p>
<p>I cannot say, then, precisely in what way, but I can see no
reason for doubting that in some of the ways suggested above, or
in some combination of them, the phenomena of the instincts of
neuter ants and bees can be brought into the same category as the
instincts and structure of fertile animals.&nbsp; At any rate, I
see the great fact that when treated as they have been accustomed
to be treated, these neuters act as though they remembered, and
accordingly become queen bees; and that they only depart from
their ancestral course on being treated in such fashion as their
ancestors can never have remembered; also, that when they have
been thrown off their accustomed line of thought and action, they
only take that of their nurses, who have been about them from the
moment of their being deposited as eggs by the queen bee, who
have fed them from their own bodies, and between whom and them
there may have been all manner of physical and mental
communication, of which we know no more than we do of the power
which enables a bee to find its way home after infinite shifting
and turning among flowers, which no human powers could
systematise so as to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Or take it thus: We know that mutilation at an early age
produces an effect upon the structure and instincts of cattle,
sheep, and horses; and it might be presumed that if feasible at
an earlier age, it would produce a still more marked
effect.&nbsp; We observe that the effect produced is uniform, or
nearly so.&nbsp; Suppose mutilation to produce a little more
effect than it does, as we might easily do, if cattle, sheep, and
horses had been for ages accustomed to a mutilated class living
among them, which class had been always a caste apart, and had
fed the young neuters from their own bodies, from an early
embryonic stage onwards; would any one in this case dream of
advancing the structure and instincts of this mutilated class
against the doctrine that instinct is inherited habit?&nbsp; Or,
if inclined to do this, would he not at once refrain, on
remembering that the process of mutilation might be arrested, and
the embryo be developed into an entire animal by simply treating
it in the way to which all its ancestors had been
accustomed?&nbsp; Surely he would not allow the difficulty (which
I must admit in some measure to remain) to outweigh the evidence
derivable from these very neuter insects themselves, as well as
from such a vast number of other sources&mdash;all pointing in
the direction of instinct as inherited habit. <a
name="citation239"></a><a href="#footnote239"
class="citation">[239]</a></p>
<p>Lastly, it must be remembered that the instinct to make cells
and honey is one which has no very great hold upon its
possessors.&nbsp; Bees <i>can</i> make cells and honey, nor do
they seem to have any very violent objection to doing so; but it
is quite clear that there is nothing in their structure and
instincts which urges them on to do these things for the mere
love of doing them, as a hen is urged to sit upon a chalk stone,
concerning which she probably is at heart utterly sceptical,
rather than not sit at all.&nbsp; There is no honey and
cell-making instinct so strong as the instinct to eat, if they
are hungry, or to grow wings, and make themselves into bees at
all.&nbsp; Like ourselves, so long as they can get plenty to eat
and drink, they will do no work.&nbsp; Under these circumstances,
not one drop of honey nor one particle of wax will they collect,
except, I presume, to make cells for the rearing of their
young.</p>
<p>Sydney Smith writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most curious instance of a change of instinct is
recorded by Darwin.&nbsp; The bees carried over to Barbadoes and
the Western Isles ceased to lay up any honey after the first
year, as they found it not useful to them.&nbsp; They found the
weather so fine, and materials for making honey so plentiful,
that they quitted their grave, prudent, and mercantile character,
became exceedingly profligate and debauched, ate up their
capital, resolved to work no more, and amused themselves by
flying about the sugar-houses and stinging the blacks&rdquo;
(Lecture XVII. on Moral Philosophy).&nbsp; The ease, then, with
which the honey-gathering and cell-making habits are
relinquished, would seem to point strongly in the direction of
their acquisition at a comparatively late period of
development.</p>
<p>I have dealt with bees only, and not with ants, which would
perhaps seem to present greater difficulty, inasmuch as in some
families of these there are two, or even three, castes of neuters
with well-marked and wide differences of structure and instinct;
but I think the reader will agree with me that the ants are
sufficiently covered by the bees, and that enough, therefore, has
been said already.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin supposes that these
modifications of structure and instinct have been effected by the
accumulation of numerous slight, profitable, spontaneous
variations on the part of the fertile parents, which has caused
them (so, at least, I understand him) to lay this or that
particular kind of egg, which should develop into a kind of bee
or ant, with this or that particular instinct, which instinct is
merely a co-ordination with structure, and in no way attributable
to use or habit in preceding generations.</p>
<p>Even so, one cannot see that the habit of laying this
particular kind of egg might not be due to use and memory in
previous generations on the part of the fertile parents,
&ldquo;for the numerous slight spontaneous variations,&rdquo; on
which &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; is to work, must have had
some cause than which none more reasonable than sense of need and
experience presents itself; and there seems hardly any limit to
what long-continued faith and desire, aided by intelligence, may
be able to effect.&nbsp; But if sense of need and experience are
denied, I see no escape from the view that machines are new
species of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin concludes: &ldquo;I am surprised that no one has
hitherto advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects
against the well-known doctrine of inherited habit as advanced by
Lamarck&rdquo; (&ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; p. 233, ed.
1876).</p>
<p>After reading this, one feels as though there was no more to
be said.&nbsp; The well-known doctrine of inherited habit, as
advanced by Lamarck, has indeed been long since so thoroughly
exploded, that it is not worth while to go into an explanation of
what it was, or to refute it in detail.&nbsp; Here, however, is
an argument against it, which is so much better than anything
advanced yet, that one is surprised it has never been made use
of; so we will just advance it, as it were, to slay the slain,
and pass on.&nbsp; Such, at least, is the effect which the
paragraph above quoted produced upon myself, and would, I think,
produce on the great majority of readers.&nbsp; When driven by
the exigencies of my own position to examine the value of the
demonstration more closely, I conclude, either that I have
utterly failed to grasp Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s meaning, or that I
have no less completely mistaken the value and bearing of the
facts I have myself advanced in these few last pages.&nbsp;
Failing this, my surprise is, not that &ldquo;no one has hitherto
advanced&rdquo; the instincts of neuter insects as a
demonstrative case against the doctrine of inherited habit, but
rather that Mr. Darwin should have thought the case
demonstrative; or again, when I remember that the neuter working
bee is only an aborted queen, and may be turned back again into a
queen, by giving it such treatment as it can alone be expected to
remember&mdash;then I am surprised that the structure and
instincts of neuter bees has never (if never) been brought
forward in support of the doctrine of inherited habit as advanced
by Lamarck, and against any theory which would rob such instincts
of their foundation in intelligence, and of their connection with
experience and memory.</p>
<p>As for the instinct to mutilate, that is as easily accounted
for as any other inherited habit, whether of man to mutilate
cattle, or of ants to make slaves, or of birds to make their
nests.&nbsp; I can see no way of accounting for the existence of
any one of these instincts, except on the supposition that they
have arisen gradually, through perceptions of power and need on
the part of the animal which exhibits them&mdash;these two
perceptions advancing hand in hand from generation to generation,
and being accumulated in time and in the common course of
nature.</p>
<p>I have already sufficiently guarded against being supposed to
maintain that very long before an instinct or structure was
developed, the creature descried it in the far future, and made
towards it.&nbsp; We do not observe this to be the manner of
human progress.&nbsp; Our mechanical inventions, which, as I
ventured to say in &ldquo;Erewhon,&rdquo; through the mouth of
the second professor, are really nothing but extra-corporaneous
limbs&mdash;a wooden leg being nothing but a bad kind of flesh
leg, and a flesh leg being only a much better kind of wooden leg
than any creature could be expected to manufacture
introspectively and consciously&mdash;our mechanical inventions
have almost invariably grown up from small beginnings, and
without any very distant foresight on the part of the
inventors.&nbsp; When Watt perfected the steam engine, he did
not, it seems, foresee the locomotive, much less would any one
expect a savage to invent a steam engine.&nbsp; A child breathes
automatically, because it has learnt to breathe little by little,
and has now breathed for an incalculable length of time; but it
cannot open oysters at all, nor even conceive the idea of opening
oysters for two or three years after it is born, for the simple
reason that this lesson is one which it is only beginning to
learn.&nbsp; All I maintain is, that, give a child as many
generations of practice in opening oysters as it has had in
breathing or sucking, and it would on being born, turn to the
oyster-knife no less naturally than to the breast.&nbsp; We
observe that among certain families of men there has been a
tendency to vary in the direction of the use and development of
machinery; and that in a certain still smaller number of
families, there seems to be an almost infinitely great capacity
for varying and inventing still further, whether socially or
mechanically; while other families, and perhaps the greater
number, reach a certain point and stop; but we also observe that
not even the most inventive races ever see very far ahead.&nbsp;
I suppose the progress of plants and animals to be exactly
analogous to this.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin has always maintained that the effects of use and
disuse are highly important in the development of structure, and
if, as he has said, habits are sometimes inherited&mdash;then
they should sometimes be important also in the development of
instinct, or habit.&nbsp; But what does the development of an
instinct or structure, or, indeed, any effect upon the organism
produced by &ldquo;use and disuse,&rdquo; imply?&nbsp; It implies
an effect produced by a desire to do something for which the
organism was not originally well adapted or sufficient, but for
which it has come to be sufficient in consequence of the
desire.&nbsp; The wish has been father to the power; but this
again opens up the whole theory of Lamarck, that the development
of organs has been due to the wants or desires of the animal in
which the organ appears.&nbsp; So far as I can see, I am
insisting on little more than this.</p>
<p>Once grant that a blacksmith&rsquo;s arm grows thicker through
hammering iron, and you have an organ modified in accordance with
a need or wish.&nbsp; Let the desire and the practice be
remembered, and go on for long enough, and the slight alterations
of the organ will be accumulated, until they are checked either
by the creature&rsquo;s having got all that he cares about making
serious further effort to obtain, or until his wants prove
inconvenient to other creatures that are stronger than he, and he
is hence brought to a standstill.&nbsp; Use and disuse, then,
with me, and, as I gather also, with Lamarck, are the keys to the
position, coupled, of course, with continued personality and
memory.&nbsp; No sudden and striking changes would be effected,
except that occasionally a blunder might prove a happy accident,
as happens not unfrequently with painters, musicians, chemists,
and inventors at the present day; or sometimes a creature, with
exceptional powers of memory or reflection, would make his
appearance in this race or in that.&nbsp; We all profit by our
accidents as well as by our more cunning contrivances, so that
analogy would point in the direction of thinking that many of the
most happy thoughts in the animal and vegetable kingdom were
originated much as certain discoveries that have been made by
accident among ourselves.&nbsp; These would be originally blind
variations, though even so, probably less blind than we think, if
we could know the whole truth.&nbsp; When originated, they would
be eagerly taken advantage of and improved upon by the animal in
whom they appeared; but it cannot be supposed that they would be
very far in advance of the last step gained, more than are those
&ldquo;flukes&rdquo; which sometimes enable us to go so far
beyond our own ordinary powers.&nbsp; For if they were, the
animal would despair of repeating them.&nbsp; No creature hopes,
or even wishes, for very much more than he has been accustomed to
all his life, he and his family, and the others whom he can
understand, around him.&nbsp; It has been well said that
&ldquo;enough&rdquo; is always &ldquo;a little more than one
has.&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not try for things which we believe to be
beyond our reach, hence one would expect that the fortunes, as it
were, of animals should have been built up gradually.&nbsp; Our
own riches grow with our desires and the pains we take in pursuit
of them, and our desires vary and increase with our means of
gratifying them; but unless with men of exceptional business
aptitude, wealth grows gradually by the adding field to field and
farm to farm; so with the limbs and instincts of animals; these
are but the things they have made or bought with their money, or
with money that has been left them by their forefathers, which,
though it is neither silver nor gold, but faith and protoplasm
only, is good money and capital notwithstanding.</p>
<p>I have already admitted that instinct may be modified by food
or drugs, which may affect a structure or habit as powerfully as
we see certain poisons affect the structure of plants by
producing, as Mr. Darwin tells us, very complex galls upon their
leaves.&nbsp; I do not, therefore, for a moment insist on habit
as the sole cause of instinct.&nbsp; Every habit must have had
its originating cause, and the causes which have started one
habit will from time to time start or modify others; nor can I
explain why some individuals of a race should be cleverer than
others, any more than I can explain why they should exist at all;
nevertheless, I observe it to be a fact that differences in
intelligence and power of growth are universal in the individuals
of all those races which we can best watch.&nbsp; I also most
readily admit that the common course of nature would both cause
many variations to arise independently of any desire on the part
of the animal (much as we have lately seen that the moons of Mars
were on the point of being discovered three hundred years ago,
merely through Galileo sending to Kepler a Latin anagram which
Kepler could not understand, and arranged into the
line&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Salve umbistineum geminatum Martia
prolem</i>,&rdquo; and interpreted to mean that Mars had two
moons, whereas Galileo had meant to say &ldquo;<i>Altissimum
planetam tergeminum observavi</i>,&rdquo; meaning that he had
seen Saturn&rsquo;s ring), and would also preserve and accumulate
such variations when they had arisen; but I can no more believe
that the wonderful adaptation of structures to needs, which we
see around us in such an infinite number of plants and animals,
can have arisen without a perception of those needs on the part
of the creature in whom the structure appears, than I can believe
that the form of the dray-horse or greyhound&mdash;so well
adapted both to the needs of the animal in his daily service to
man, and to the desires of man, that the creature should do him
this daily service&mdash;can have arisen without any desire on
man&rsquo;s part to produce this particular structure, or without
the inherited habit of performing the corresponding actions for
man, on the part of the greyhound and dray-horse.</p>
<p>And I believe that this will be felt as reasonable by the
great majority of my readers.&nbsp; I believe that nine fairly
intelligent and observant men out of ten, if they were asked
which they thought most likely to have been the main cause of the
development of the various phases either of structure or instinct
which we see around us, namely&mdash;sense of need, or even whim,
and hence occasional discovery, helped by an occasional piece of
good luck, communicated, it may be, and generally adopted, long
practised, remembered by offspring, modified by changed
surroundings, and accumulated in the course of time&mdash;or, the
accumulation of small divergent, indefinite, and perfectly
unintelligent variations, preserved through the survival of their
possessor in the struggle for existence, and hence in time
leading to wide differences from the original type&mdash;would
answer in favour of the former alternative; and if for no other
cause yet for this&mdash;that in the human race, which we are
best able to watch, and between which and the lower animals no
difference in kind will, I think, be supposed, but only in
degree, we observe that progress must have an internal current
setting in a definite direction, but whither we know not for very
long beforehand; and that without such internal current there is
stagnation.&nbsp; Our own progress&mdash;or variation&mdash;is
due not to small, fortuitous inventions or modifications which
have enabled their fortunate possessors to survive in times of
difficulty, not, in fact, to strokes of luck (though these, of
course, have had some effect&mdash;but not more, probably, than
strokes of ill luck have counteracted) but to strokes of
cunning&mdash;to a sense of need, and to study of the past and
present which have given shrewd people a key with which to unlock
the chambers of the future.</p>
<p>Further, Mr. Darwin himself says (&ldquo;Plants and Animals
under Domestication,&rdquo; ii. p. 237, ed. 1875):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I think we must take a broader view and conclude
that organic beings when subjected during several generations to
any change whatever in their conditions tend to vary: <i>the kind
of variation which ensues depending in most cases in a far higher
degree on the nature or constitution of the being</i>, <i>than on
the nature of the changed conditions</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this
we observe in man.&nbsp; The history of a man prior to his birth
is more important as far as his success or failure goes than his
surroundings after birth, important though these may indeed
be.&nbsp; The able man rises in spite of a thousand hindrances,
the fool fails in spite of every advantage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Natural
selection,&rdquo; however, does not make either the able man or
the fool.&nbsp; It only deals with him after other causes have
made him, and would seem in the end to amount to little more than
to a statement of the fact that when variations have arisen they
will accumulate.&nbsp; One cannot look, as has already been said,
for the origin of species in that part of the course of nature
which settles the preservation or extinction of variations which
have already arisen from some unknown cause, but one must look
for it in the causes that have led to variation at all.&nbsp;
These causes must get, as it were, behind the back of
&ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; which is rather a shield and
hindrance to our perception of our own ignorance than an
explanation of what these causes are.</p>
<p>The remarks made above will apply equally to plants such as
the misletoe and red clover.&nbsp; For the sake of brevity I will
deal only with the misletoe, which seems to be the more striking
case.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturalists continually refer to external conditions,
such as climate, food, &amp;c., as the only possible cause of
variation.&nbsp; In one limited sense, as we shall hereafter see,
this may be true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere
external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the
woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably
adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees.&nbsp; In the
case of the misletoe, which draws its nourishment from certain
trees, which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds,
and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring
the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to
another, it is equally preposterous to account for the structure
of this parasite with its relations to several distinct organic
beings, by the effect of external conditions, or of habit, or of
the volition of the plant itself&rdquo; (&ldquo;Natural
Selection,&rdquo; p. 3, ed. 1876).</p>
<p>I cannot see this.&nbsp; To me it seems still more
preposterous to account for it by the action of &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; operating upon indefinite variations.&nbsp; It
would be preposterous to suppose that a bird very different from
a woodpecker should have had a conception of a woodpecker, and so
by volition gradually grown towards it.&nbsp; So in like manner
with the misletoe.&nbsp; Neither plant nor bird knew how far they
were going, or saw more than a very little ahead as to the means
of remedying this or that with which they were dissatisfied, or
of getting this or that which they desired; but given perceptions
at all, and thus a sense of needs and of the gratification of
those needs, and thus hope and fear, and a sense of content and
discontent&mdash;given also the lowest power of gratifying those
needs&mdash;given also that some individuals have these powers in
a higher degree than others&mdash;given also continued
personality and memory over a vast extent of time&mdash;and the
whole phenomena of species and genera resolve themselves into an
illustration of the old proverb, that what is one man&rsquo;s
meat is another man&rsquo;s poison.&nbsp; Life in its lowest form
under the above conditions&mdash;and we cannot conceive of life
at all without them&mdash;would be bound to vary, and to result
after not so very many millions of years in the infinite forms
and instincts which we see around us.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">LAMARCK AND MR. DARWIN.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will have been seen that in the
preceding pages the theory of evolution, as originally propounded
by Lamarck, has been more than once supported, as against the
later theory concerning it put forward by Mr. Darwin, and now
generally accepted.</p>
<p>It is not possible for me, within the limits at my command, to
do anything like justice to the arguments that may be brought
forward in favour of either of these two theories.&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s books are at the command of every one; and so much
has been discovered since Lamarck&rsquo;s day, that if he were
living now, he would probably state his case very differently; I
shall therefore content myself with a few brief remarks, which
will hardly, however, aspire to the dignity of argument.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Darwin, differentiations of structure and
instinct have mainly come about through the accumulation of
small, fortuitous variations without intelligence or desire upon
the part of the creature varying; modification, however, through
desire and sense of need, is not denied entirely, inasmuch as
considerable effect is ascribed by Mr. Darwin to use and disuse,
which involves, as has been already said, the modification of a
structure in accordance with the wishes of its possessor.</p>
<p>According to Lamarck, genera and species have been evolved, in
the main, by exactly the same process as that by which human
inventions and civilisations are now progressing; and this
involves that intelligence, ingenuity, heroism, and all the
elements of romance, should have had the main share in the
development of every herb and living creature around us.</p>
<p>I take the following brief outline of the most important part
of Lamarck&rsquo;s theory from vol. xxxvi. of the
Naturalist&rsquo;s Library (Edinburgh, 1843):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more simple bodies,&rdquo; says the editor, giving
Lamarck&rsquo;s opinion without endorsing it, &ldquo;are easily
formed, and this being the case, it is easy to conceive how in
the lapse of time animals of a more complex structure should be
produced, <i>for it must be admitted as a fundamental law</i>,
<i>that the production of a new organ in an animal body results
from any new want or desire it may experience</i>.&nbsp; The
first effort of a being just beginning to develop itself must be
to procure subsistence, and hence in time there comes to be
produced a stomach or alimentary cavity.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Thus we
saw that the am&oelig;ba is in the habit of
&ldquo;extemporising&rdquo; a stomach when it wants one.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Other wants occasioned by circumstances will lead to other
efforts, which in their turn will generate new organs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamarck&rsquo;s wonderful conception was hampered by an
unnecessary adjunct, namely, a belief in an inherent tendency
towards progressive development in every low organism.&nbsp; He
was thus driven to account for the presence of many very low and
very ancient organisms at the present day, and fell back upon the
theory, which is not yet supported by evidence, that such low
forms are still continually coming into existence from inorganic
matter.&nbsp; But there seems no necessity to suppose that all
low forms should possess an inherent tendency towards
progression.&nbsp; It would be enough that there should
occasionally arise somewhat more gifted specimens of one or more
original forms.&nbsp; These would vary, and the ball would be
thus set rolling, while the less gifted would remain <i>in statu
quo</i>, provided they were sufficiently gifted to escape
extinction.</p>
<p>Nor do I gather that Lamarck insisted on continued personality
and memory so as to account for heredity at all, and so as to see
life as a single, or as at any rate, only a few, vast compound
animals, but without the connecting organism between each
component item in the whole creature, which is found in animals
that are strictly called compound.&nbsp; Until continued
personality and memory are connected with the idea of heredity,
heredity of any kind is little more than a term for something
which one does not understand.&nbsp; But there seems little
<i>&agrave; priori</i> difficulty as regards Lamarck&rsquo;s main
idea, now that Mr. Darwin has familiarised us with evolution, and
made us feel what a vast array of facts can be brought forward in
support of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin tells us, in the preface to his last edition of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; that Lamarck was partly led to
his conclusions by the analogy of domestic productions.&nbsp; It
is rather hard to say what these words imply; they may mean
anything from a baby to an apple dumpling, but if they imply that
Lamarck drew inspirations from the gradual development of the
mechanical inventions of man, and from the progress of
man&rsquo;s ideas, I would say that of all sources this would
seem to be the safest and most fertile from which to draw.</p>
<p>Plants and animals under domestication are indeed a suggestive
field for study, but machines are the manner in which man is
varying at this moment.&nbsp; We know how our own minds work, and
how our mechanical organisations&mdash;for, in all sober
seriousness, this is what it comes to&mdash;have progressed hand
in hand with our desires; sometimes the power a little ahead, and
sometimes the desire; sometimes both combining to form an organ
with almost infinite capacity for variation, and sometimes
comparatively early reaching the limit of utmost development in
respect of any new conception, and accordingly coming to a full
stop; sometimes making leaps and bounds, and sometimes advancing
sluggishly.&nbsp; Here we are behind the scenes, and can see how
the whole thing works.&nbsp; We have man, the very animal which
we can best understand, caught in the very act of variation,
through his own needs, and not through the needs of others; the
whole process is a natural one; the varying of a creature as much
in a wild state as the ants and butterflies are wild.&nbsp; There
is less occasion here for the continual &ldquo;might be&rdquo;
and &ldquo;may be,&rdquo; which we are compelled to put up with
when dealing with plants and animals, of the workings of whose
minds we can only obscurely judge.&nbsp; Also, there is more
prospect of pecuniary profit attaching to the careful study of
machinery than can be generally hoped for from the study of the
lower animals; and though I admit that this consideration should
not be carried too far, a great deal of very unnecessary
suffering will be spared to the lower animals; for much that
passes for natural history is little better than prying into
other people&rsquo;s business, from no other motive than
curiosity.&nbsp; I would, therefore, strongly advise the reader
to use man, and the present races of man, and the growing
inventions and conceptions of man, as his guide, if he would seek
to form an independent judgement on the development of organic
life.&nbsp; For all growth is only somebody making something.</p>
<p>Lamarck&rsquo;s theories fell into disrepute, partly because
they were too startling to be capable of ready fusion with
existing ideas; they were, in fact, too wide a cross for
fertility; partly because they fell upon evil times, during the
reaction that followed the French Revolution; partly because,
unless I am mistaken, he did not sufficiently link on the
experience of the race to that of the individual, nor perceive
the importance of the principle that consciousness, memory,
volition, intelligence, &amp;c., vanish, or become latent, on
becoming intense.&nbsp; He also appears to have mixed up matter
with his system, which was either plainly wrong, or so incapable
of proof as to enable people to laugh at him, and pooh-pooh him;
but I believe it will come to be perceived, that he has received
somewhat scant justice at the hands of his successors, and that
his &ldquo;crude theories,&rdquo; as they have been somewhat
cheaply called, are far from having had their last say.</p>
<p>Returning to Mr. Darwin, we find, as we have already seen,
that it is hard to say exactly how much Mr. Darwin differs from
Lamarck, and how much he agrees with him.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin has
always maintained that use and disuse are highly important, and
this implies that the effect produced on the parent should be
remembered by the offspring, in the same way as the memory of a
wound is transmitted by one set of cells to succeeding ones, who
long repeat the scar, though it may fade finally away.&nbsp;
Also, after dealing with the manner in which one eye of a young
flat-fish travels round the head till both eyes are on the same
side of the fish, he gives (&ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; p.
188, ed. 1875) an instance of a structure &ldquo;which apparently
owes its origin exclusively to use or habit.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
refers to the tail of some American monkeys &ldquo;which has been
converted into a wonderfully perfect prehensile organ, and serves
as a fifth hand.&nbsp; A reviewer,&rdquo; he continues, . .
.&nbsp; &ldquo;remarks on this structure&mdash;&lsquo;It is
impossible to believe that in any number of ages the first slight
incipient tendency to grasp, could preserve the lives of the
individuals possessing it, or favour their chance of having and
of rearing offspring.&rsquo;&nbsp; But there is no necessity for
any such belief.&nbsp; Habit, and this almost implies that some
benefit, great or small, is thus derived, would in all
probability suffice for the work.&rdquo;&nbsp; If, then, habit
can do this&mdash;and it is no small thing to develop a
wonderfully perfect prehensile organ which can serve as a fifth
hand&mdash;how much more may not habit do, even though unaided,
as Mr. Darwin supposes to have been the case in this instance, by
&ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;?&nbsp; After attributing many of
the structural and instinctive differences of plants and animals
to the effects of use&mdash;as we may plainly do with Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s own consent&mdash;after attributing a good deal
more to unknown causes, and a good deal to changed conditions,
which are bound, if at all important, to result either in
sterility or variation&mdash;how much of the work of originating
species is left for natural selection?&mdash;which, as Mr. Darwin
admits (&ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; p. 63, ed. 1876), does
not <i>induce variability</i>, but &ldquo;implies only the
preservation of <i>such variations as arise</i>, and are
beneficial to the being under its conditions of
life?&rdquo;&nbsp; An important part assuredly, and one which we
can never sufficiently thank Mr. Darwin for having put so
forcibly before us, but an indirect part only, like the part
played by time and space, and not, I think, the one which Mr.
Darwin would assign to it.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin himself has admitted that in the earlier editions
of his &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; he &ldquo;underrated, as
it now seems probable, the frequency and importance of
modifications due to spontaneous variability.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
this involves the having over-rated the action of &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; as an agent in the evolution of species.&nbsp;
But one gathers that he still believes the accumulation of small
and fortuitous variations through the agency of &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; to be the main cause of the present divergencies
of structure and instinct.&nbsp; I do not, however, think that
Mr. Darwin is clear about his own meaning.&nbsp; I think the
prominence given to &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; in connection
with the &ldquo;origin of species&rdquo; has led him, in spite of
himself, and in spite of his being on his guard (as is clearly
shown by the paragraph on page 63 &ldquo;Natural
Selection,&rdquo; above referred to), to regard &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; as in some way accounting for variation, just as
the use of the dangerous word
&ldquo;spontaneous,&rdquo;&mdash;though he is so often on his
guard against it, and so frequently prefaces it with the words
&ldquo;so-called,&rdquo;&mdash;would seem to have led him into
very serious confusion of thought in the passage quoted at the
beginning of this paragraph.</p>
<p>For after saying that he had underrated &ldquo;the frequency
and importance of modifications due to spontaneous
variability,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;but it is impossible to
attribute to this cause the innumerable structures which are so
well adapted to the habits of life of each species.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That is to say, it is impossible to attribute these innumerable
structures to spontaneous variability.</p>
<p>What <i>is</i> spontaneous variability?</p>
<p>Clearly, from his preceding paragraph, Mr. Darwin means only
&ldquo;so-called spontaneous variations,&rdquo; such as
&ldquo;the appearance of a moss-rose on a common rose, or of a
nectarine on a peach-tree,&rdquo; which he gives as good examples
of so-called spontaneous variation.</p>
<p>And these variations are, after all, due to causes, but to
unknown causes; spontaneous variation being, in fact, but another
name for variation due to causes which we know nothing about, but
in no possible sense a <i>cause of variation</i>.&nbsp; So that
when we come to put clearly before our minds exactly what the
sentence we are considering amounts to, it comes to this: that it
is impossible to attribute the innumerable structures which are
so well adapted to the habits of life of each species to
<i>unknown causes</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can no more believe in <i>this</i>,&rdquo; continues
Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;than that the well-adapted form of a
race-horse or greyhound, which, before the principle of selection
by man was well understood, excited so much surprise in the minds
of the older naturalists, can <i>thus</i> be explained&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; p. 171, ed. 1876).</p>
<p>Or, in other words, &ldquo;I can no more believe that the
well-adapted structures of species are due to unknown causes,
than I can believe that the well-adapted form of a race-horse can
be explained by being attributed to unknown causes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have puzzled over this paragraph for several hours with the
sincerest desire to get at the precise idea which underlies it,
but the more I have studied it the more convinced I am that it
does not contain, or at any rate convey, any clear or definite
idea at all.&nbsp; If I thought it was a mere slip, I should not
call attention to it; this book will probably have slips enough
of its own without introducing those of a great man
unnecessarily; but I submit that it is necessary to call
attention to it here, inasmuch as it is impossible to believe
that after years of reflection upon his subject, Mr. Darwin
should have written as above, especially in such a place, if his
mind was really clear about his own position.&nbsp; Immediately
after the admission of a certain amount of miscalculation, there
comes a more or less exculpatory sentence which sounds so right
that ninety-nine people out of a hundred would walk through it,
unless led by some exigency of their own position to examine it
closely but which yet upon examination proves to be as nearly
meaningless as a sentence can be.</p>
<p>The weak point in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory would seem to be a
deficiency, so to speak, of motive power to originate and direct
the variations which time is to accumulate.&nbsp; It deals
admirably with the accumulation of variations in creatures
already varying, but it does not provide a sufficient number of
sufficiently important variations to be accumulated.&nbsp; Given
the motive power which Lamarck suggested, and Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
mechanism would appear (with the help of memory, as bearing upon
reproduction, of continued personality, and hence of inherited
habit, and of the vanishing tendency of consciousness) to work
with perfect ease.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin has made us all feel that in
some way or other variations <i>are accumulated</i>, and that
evolution is the true solution of the present widely different
structures around us, whereas, before he wrote, hardly any one
believed this.&nbsp; However we may differ from him in detail,
the present general acceptance of evolution must remain as his
work, and a more valuable work can hardly be imagined.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, I cannot think that &ldquo;natural
selection,&rdquo; working upon small, fortuitous, indefinite,
unintelligent variations, would produce the results we see around
us.&nbsp; One wants something that will give a more definite aim
to variations, and hence, at times, cause bolder leaps in
advance.&nbsp; One cannot but doubt whether so many plants and
animals would be being so continually saved &ldquo;by the skin of
their teeth,&rdquo; as must be so saved if the variations from
which genera ultimately arise are as small in their commencement
and at each successive stage as Mr. Darwin seems to
believe.&nbsp; God&mdash;to use the language of the
Bible&mdash;is not extreme to mark what is done amiss, whether
with plant or beast or man; on the other hand, when towers of
Siloam fall, they fall on the just as well as the unjust.</p>
<p>One feels, on considering Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s position, that if
it be admitted that there is in the lowest creature a power to
vary, no matter how small, one has got in this power as near the
&ldquo;origin of species&rdquo; as one can ever hope to
get.&nbsp; For no one professes to account for the origin of
life; but if a creature with a power to vary reproduces itself at
all, it must reproduce another creature <i>which shall also have
the power to vary</i>; so that, given time and space enough,
there is no knowing where such a creature could or would
stop.</p>
<p>If the primordial cell had been only capable of reproducing
itself once, there would have followed a single line of
descendants, the chain of which might at any moment have been
broken by casualty.&nbsp; Doubtless the millionth repetition
would have differed very materially from the original&mdash;as
widely, perhaps, as we differ from the primordial cell; but it
would only have differed by addition, and could no more in any
generation resume its latest development without having passed
through the initial stage of being what its first forefather was,
and doing what its first forefather did, and without going
through all or a sufficient number of the steps whereby it had
reached its latest differentiation, than water can rise above its
own level.</p>
<p>The very idea, then, of reproduction involves, unless I am
mistaken, that, no matter how much the creature reproducing
itself may gain in power and versatility, it must still always
begin <i>with itself again</i> in each generation.&nbsp; The
primordial cell being capable of reproducing itself not only
once, but many times over, each of the creatures which it
produces must be similarly gifted; hence the geometrical ratio of
increase and the existing divergence of type.&nbsp; In each
generation it will pass rapidly and unconsciously through all the
earlier stages of which there has been infinite experience, and
for which the conditions are reproduced with sufficient
similarity to cause no failure of memory or hesitation; but in
each generation, when it comes to the part in which the course is
not so clear, it will become conscious; still, however, where the
course is plain, as in breathing, digesting, &amp;c., retaining
unconsciousness.&nbsp; Thus organs which present all the
appearance of being designed&mdash;as, for example, the tip for
its beak prepared by the embryo chicken&mdash;would be prepared
in the end, as it were, by rote, and without sense of design,
though none the less owing their origin to design.</p>
<p>The question is not concerning evolution, but as to the main
cause which has led to evolution in such and such shapes.&nbsp;
To me it seems that the &ldquo;Origin of Variation,&rdquo;
whatever it is, is the only true &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo;
and that this must, as Lamarck insisted, be looked for in the
needs and experiences of the creatures varying.&nbsp; Unless we
can explain the origin of variations, we are met by the
unexplained <i>at every step</i> in the progress of a creature
from its original homogeneous condition to its differentiation,
we will say, as an elephant; so that to say that an elephant has
become an elephant through the accumulation of a vast number of
small, fortuitous, but unexplained, variations in some lower
creatures, is really to say that it has become an elephant owing
to a series of causes about which we know nothing whatever, or,
in other words, that one does not know how it came to be an
elephant.&nbsp; But to say that an elephant has become an
elephant owing to a series of variations, nine-tenths of which
were caused by the wishes of the creature or creatures from which
the elephant is descended&mdash;this is to offer a reason, and
definitely put the insoluble one step further back.&nbsp; The
question will then turn upon the sufficiency of the
reason&mdash;that is to say, whether the hypothesis is borne out
by facts.</p>
<p>The effects of competition would, of course, have an extremely
important effect upon any creature, in the same way as any other
condition of nature under which it lived, must affect its sense
of need and its opinions generally.&nbsp; The results of
competition would be, as it were, the decisions of an arbiter
settling the question whether such and such variation was really
to the animal&rsquo;s advantage or not&mdash;a matter on which
the animal will, on the whole, have formed a pretty fair
judgement for itself.&nbsp; <i>Undoubtedly the past decisions of
such an arbiter would affect the conduct of the creature</i>,
which would have doubtless had its shortcomings and blunders, and
would amend them.&nbsp; The creature would shape its course
according to its experience of the common course of events, but
it would be continually trying and often successfully, to evade
the law by all manner of sharp practice.&nbsp; New precedents
would thus arise, so that the law would shift with time and
circumstances; but the law would not otherwise direct the
channels into which life would flow, than as laws, whether
natural or artificial, have affected the development of the
widely differing trades and professions among mankind.&nbsp;
These have had their origin rather in the needs and experiences
of mankind than in any laws.</p>
<p>To put much the same as the above in different words.&nbsp;
Assume that small favourable variations are preserved more
commonly, in proportion to their numbers, than is perhaps the
case, and assume that considerable variations occur more rarely
than they probably do occur, how account for any variation at
all?&nbsp; &ldquo;Natural selection&rdquo; cannot <i>create</i>
the smallest variation unless it acts through perception of its
mode of operation, recognised inarticulately, but none the less
clearly, by the creature varying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Natural
selection&rdquo; operates on what it finds, and not on what it
has made.&nbsp; Animals that have been wise and lucky live longer
and breed more than others less wise and lucky.&nbsp;
Assuredly.&nbsp; The wise and lucky animals transmit their wisdom
and luck.&nbsp; Assuredly.&nbsp; They add to their powers, and
diverge into widely different directions.&nbsp; Assuredly.&nbsp;
What is the cause of this?&nbsp; Surely the fact that they were
capable of feeling needs, and that they differed in their needs
and manner of gratifying them, and that they continued to live in
successive generations, rather than the fact that when lucky and
wise they thrived and bred more descendants.&nbsp; This last is
an accessory hardly less important for the <i>development</i> of
species than the fact of the continuation of life at all; but it
is an accessory of much the same kind as this, for if animals
continue to live at all, they must live <i>in some way</i>, and
will find that there are good ways and bad ways of living.&nbsp;
An animal which discovers the good way will gradually develop
further powers, and so species will get further and further
apart; but the origin of this is to be looked for, not in the
power which decides whether this or that way was good, but in the
cause which determines the creature, consciously or
unconsciously, to try this or that way.</p>
<p>But Mr. Darwin might say that this is not a fair way of
stating the issue.&nbsp; He might say, &ldquo;You beg the
question; you assume that there is an inherent tendency in
animals towards progressive development, whereas I say that there
is no good evidence of any such tendency.&nbsp; I maintain that
the differences that have from time to time arisen have come
about mainly from causes so far beyond our ken, that we can only
call them spontaneous; and if so, natural selection which you
must allow to have at any rate played an important part in the
<i>accumulation</i> of variations, must also be allowed to be the
nearest thing to the cause of Specific differences, which we are
able to arrive at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he writes (&ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; p. 176, ed.
1876): &ldquo;Although we have no good evidence of the existence
in organic beings of a tendency towards progressive development,
yet this necessarily follows, as I have attempted to show in the
fourth chapter, through the continued action of natural
selection.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Darwin does not say that organic
beings have no tendency to vary at all, but only that there is no
good evidence that they have a tendency to progressive
development, which, I take it, means, to see an ideal a long way
off, and very different to their present selves, which ideal they
think will suit them, and towards which they accordingly
make.&nbsp; I would admit this as contrary to all
experience.&nbsp; I doubt whether plants and animals have any
<i>innate tendency to vary</i> at all, being led to question this
by gathering from &ldquo;Plants and Animals under
Domestication&rdquo; that this is Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s own
opinion.&nbsp; I am inclined rather to think that they have only
an innate <i>power to vary</i> slightly, in accordance with
changed conditions, and an innate capability of being affected
both in structure and instinct, by causes similar to those which
we observe to affect ourselves.&nbsp; But however this may be,
they do vary somewhat, and unless they did, they would not in
time have come to be so widely different from each other as they
now are.&nbsp; The question is as to the origin and character of
these variations.</p>
<p>We say they mainly originate in a creature through a sense of
its needs, and vary through the varying surroundings which will
cause those needs to vary, and through the opening up of new
desires in many creatures, as the consequence of the
gratification of old ones; they depend greatly on differences of
individual capacity and temperament; they are communicated, and
in the course of time transmitted, as what we call hereditary
habits or structures, though these are only, in truth, intense
and epitomised memories of how certain creatures liked to deal
with protoplasm.&nbsp; The question whether this or that is
really good or ill, is settled, as the proof of the pudding by
the eating thereof, <i>i.e.</i>, by the rigorous competitive
examinations through which most living organisms must pass.&nbsp;
Mr. Darwin says that there is no good evidence in support of any
great principle, or tendency on the part of the creature itself,
which would steer variation, as it were, and keep its head
straight, but that the most marvellous adaptations of structures
to needs are simply the result of small and blind variations,
accumulated by the operation of &ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo;
which is thus the main cause of the origin of species.</p>
<p>Enough has perhaps already been said to make the reader feel
that the question wants reopening; I shall, therefore, here only
remark that we may assume no fundamental difference as regards
intelligence, memory, and sense of needs to exist between man and
the lowest animals, and that in man we do distinctly see a
tendency towards progressive development, operating through his
power of profiting by and transmitting his experience, but
operating in directions which man cannot foresee for any long
distance.&nbsp; We also see this in many of the higher animals
under domestication, as with horses which have learnt to canter
and dogs which point; more especially we observe it along the
line of latest development, where equilibrium of settled
convictions has not yet been fully attained.&nbsp; One neither
finds nor expects much <i>a priori</i> knowledge, whether in man
or beast; but one does find some little in the beginnings of, and
throughout the development of, every habit, at the commencement
of which, and on every successive improvement in which, deductive
and inductive methods are, as it were, fused.&nbsp; Thus the
effect, where we can best watch its causes, seems mainly produced
by a desire for a definite object&mdash;in some cases a serious
and sensible desire, in others an idle one, in others, again, a
mistaken one; and sometimes by a blunder which, in the hands of
an otherwise able creature, has turned up trumps.&nbsp; In wild
animals and plants the divergences have been accumulated, if they
answered to the prolonged desires of the creature itself, and if
these desires were to its true ultimate good; with plants or
animals under domestication they have been accumulated if they
answered a little to the original wishes of the creature, and
much, to the wishes of man.&nbsp; As long as man continued to
like them, they would be advantageous to the creature; when he
tired of them, they would be disadvantageous to it, and would
accumulate no longer.&nbsp; Surely the results produced in the
adaptation of structure to need among many plants and insects are
better accounted for on this, which I suppose to be
Lamarck&rsquo;s view, namely, by supposing that what goes on
amongst ourselves has gone on amongst all creatures, than by
supposing that these adaptations are the results of perfectly
blind and unintelligent variations.</p>
<p>Let me give two examples of such adaptations, taken from Mr.
St. George Mivart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genesis of Species,&rdquo; to
which work I would wish particularly to call the reader&rsquo;s
attention.&nbsp; He should also read Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s answers
to Mr. Mivart (p. 176, &ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; ed. 1876,
and onwards).</p>
<p>Mr. Mivart writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some insects which imitate leaves extend the imitation
even to the very injuries on those leaves made by the attacks of
insects or fungi.&nbsp; Thus speaking of the walking-stick
insects, Mr. Wallace says, &lsquo;One of these creatures obtained
by myself in Borneo (<i>ceroxylus laceratus</i>) was covered over
with foliaceous excrescences of a clear olive green colour, so as
exactly to resemble a stick grown over by a creeping moss or
jungermannia.&nbsp; The Dyak who brought it me assured me it was
grown over with moss, though alive, and it was only after a most
minute examination that I could convince myself it was not
so.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, as to the leaf butterfly, he says,
&lsquo;We come to a still more extraordinary part of the
imitation, for we find representations of leaves in every stage
of decay, variously blotched, and mildewed, and pierced with
holes, and in many cases irregularly covered with powdery black
dots, gathered into patches and spots so closely resembling the
various kinds of minute fungi that grow on dead leaves, that it
is impossible to avoid thinking at first sight that the
butterflies themselves have been attacked by real
fungi.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can no more believe that these artificial fungi in which the
moth arrays itself are due to the accumulation of minute,
perfectly blind, and unintelligent variations, than I can believe
that the artificial flowers which a woman wears in her hat can
have got there without design; or that a detective puts on plain
clothes without the slightest intention of making his victim
think that he is not a policeman.</p>
<p>Again Mr. Mivart writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the work just referred to (&lsquo;The Fertilisation
of Orchids&rsquo;), Mr. Darwin gives a series of the most
wonderful and minute contrivances, by which the visits of insects
are utilised for the fertilisation of orchids&mdash;structures so
wonderful that nothing could well be more so, except the
attribution of their origin to minute, fortuitous, and indefinite
variations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The instances are too numerous and too long to quote,
but in his &lsquo;Origin of Species&rsquo; he describes two which
must not be passed over.&nbsp; In one (<i>coryanthes</i>) the
orchid has its lower lip enlarged into a bucket, above which
stand two water-secreting horns.&nbsp; These latter replenish the
bucket, from which, when half-filled, the water overflows by a
spout on one side.&nbsp; Bees visiting the flower fall into the
bucket and crawl out at the spout.&nbsp; By the peculiar
arrangement of the parts of the flower, the first bee which does
so, carries away the pollen mass glued to his back, and then when
he has his next involuntary bath in another flower, as he crawls
out, the pollen attached to him comes in contact with the stigma
of that second flower and fertilises it.&nbsp; In the other
example (<i>catasetum</i>), when a bee gnaws a certain part of
the flower, he inevitably touches a long delicate projection
which Mr. Darwin calls the &lsquo;antenna.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;This antenna transmits a vibration to a membrane which is
instantly ruptured; this sets free a spring by which the pollen
mass is shot forth like an arrow in the right direction, and
adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the
bee&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Genesis of Species,&rdquo; p. 63).</p>
<p>No one can tell a story so charmingly as Mr. Darwin, but I can
no more believe that all this has come about without design on
the part of the orchid, and a gradual perception of the
advantages it is able to take over the bee, and a righteous
determination to enjoy them, than I can believe that a mousetrap
or a steam-engine is the result of the accumulation of blind
minute fortuitous variations in a creature called man, which
creature has never wanted either mousetraps or steam-engines, but
has had a sort of promiscuous tendency to make them, and was
benefited by making them, so that those of the race who had a
tendency to make them survived and left issue, which issue would
thus naturally tend to make more mousetraps and more
steam-engines.</p>
<p>Pursuing this idea still further, can we for a moment believe
that these additions to our limbs&mdash;for this is what they
are&mdash;have mainly come about through the occasional birth of
individuals, who, without design on their own parts, nevertheless
made them better or worse, and who, accordingly, either survived
and transmitted their improvement, or perished, they and their
incapacity together?</p>
<p>When I can believe in this, then&mdash;and not till
then&mdash;can I believe in an origin of species which does not
resolve itself mainly into sense of need, faith, intelligence,
and memory.&nbsp; Then, and not till then, can I believe that
such organs as the eye and ear can have arisen in any other way
than as the result of that kind of mental ingenuity, and of moral
as well as physical capacity, without which, till then, I should
have considered such an invention as the steam-engine to be
impossible.</p>

273</span>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. MIVART AND MR. DARWIN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">distinguished</span> zoologist,
Mr. St. George Mivart,&rdquo; writes Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;has
recently collected all the objections which have ever been
advanced by myself and others against the theory of natural
selection, as propounded by Mr. Wallace and myself, and has
illustrated them with admirable art and force&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; p. 176, ed. 1876).&nbsp; I have
already referred the reader to Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s work, but quote
the above passage as showing that Mr. Mivart will not, probably,
be found to have left much unsaid that would appear to make
against Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory.&nbsp; It is incumbent upon me
both to see how far Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s objections are weighty as
against Mr. Darwin, and also whether or not they tell with equal
force against the view which I am myself advocating.&nbsp; I will
therefore touch briefly upon the most important of them, with the
purpose of showing that they are serious as against the doctrine
that small fortuitous variations are the origin of species, but
that they have no force against evolution as guided by
intelligence and memory.</p>
<p>But before doing this, I would demur to the words used by Mr.
Darwin, and just quoted above, namely, &ldquo;the theory of
natural selection.&rdquo;&nbsp; I imagine that I see in them the
fallacy which I believe to run through almost all Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s work, namely, that &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;
is a theory (if, indeed, it can be a theory at all), in some way
accounting for the origin of variation, and so of
species&mdash;&ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; as we have already
seen, being unable to &ldquo;induce variability,&rdquo; and being
only able to accumulate what&mdash;on the occasion of each
successive variation, and so during the whole process&mdash;must
have been originated by something else.</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Darwin writes&mdash;&ldquo;In considering the
origin of species it is quite conceivable that a naturalist,
reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, or their
embryological relations, their geographical distribution,
geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the
conclusion that species had not been independently created, but
had descended, like varieties from other species.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be
unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable
species inhabiting this world had been modified, so as to acquire
that perfection of structure and co-adaptation which justly
excites our admiration&rdquo; (&ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo;
p. 2, ed. 1876).</p>
<p>After reading the above we feel that nothing more satisfactory
could be desired.&nbsp; We are sure that we are in the hands of
one who can indeed tell us &ldquo;how the innumerable species
inhabiting this world have been modified,&rdquo; and we are no
less sure that though others may have written upon the subject
before, there has been, as yet, no satisfactory explanation put
forward of the grand principle upon which modification has
proceeded.&nbsp; Then follows a delightful volume, with facts
upon facts concerning animals, all showing that species is due to
successive small modifications accumulated in the course of
nature.&nbsp; But one cannot suppose that Lamarck ever doubted
this; for he can never have meant to say, that a low form of life
made itself into an elephant at one or two great bounds; and if
he did not mean this, he must have meant that it made itself into
an elephant through the accumulation of small successive
modifications; these, he must have seen, were capable of
accumulation in the scheme of nature, though he may not have
dwelt on the manner in which this is accomplished, inasmuch as it
is obviously a matter of secondary importance in comparison with
the origin of the variations themselves.&nbsp; We believe,
however, throughout Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s book, that we are being
told what we expected to be told; and so convinced are we, by the
facts adduced, that in some way or other evolution must be true,
and so grateful are we for being allowed to think this, that we
put down the volume without perceiving that, whereas Lamarck
<i>did</i> adduce a great and general cause of variation, the
insufficiency of which, in spite of errors of detail, has yet to
be shown, Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s main cause of variation resolves
itself into a confession of ignorance.</p>
<p>This, however, should detract but little from our admiration
for Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s achievement.&nbsp; Any one can make people
see a thing if he puts it in the right way, but Mr. Darwin made
us see evolution, in spite of his having put it, in what seems to
not a few, an exceedingly mistaken way.&nbsp; Yet his triumph is
complete, for no matter how much any one now moves the
foundation, he cannot shake the superstructure, which has become
so currently accepted as to be above the need of any support from
reason, and to be as difficult to destroy as it was originally
difficult of construction.&nbsp; Less than twenty years ago, we
never met with, or heard of, any one who accepted evolution; we
did not even know that such a doctrine had been ever broached;
unless it was that some one now and again said that there was a
very dreadful book going about like a rampant lion, called
&ldquo;Vestiges of Creation,&rdquo; whereon we said that we would
on no account read it, lest it should shake our faith; then we
would shake our heads and talk of the preposterous folly and
wickedness of such shallow speculations.&nbsp; Had not the book
of Genesis been written for our learning?&nbsp; Yet, now, who
seriously disputes the main principles of evolution?&nbsp; I
cannot believe that there is a bishop on the bench at this moment
who does not accept them; even the &ldquo;holy priests&rdquo;
themselves bless evolution as their predecessors blessed
Cleopatra&mdash;when they ought not.&nbsp; It is not he who first
conceives an idea, nor he who sets it on its legs and makes it go
on all fours, but he who makes other people accept the main
conclusion, whether on right grounds or on wrong ones, who has
done the greatest work as regards the promulgation of an
opinion.&nbsp; And this is what Mr. Darwin has done for
evolution.&nbsp; He has made us think that we know the origin of
species, and so of genera, in spite of his utmost efforts to
assure us that we know nothing of the causes from which the vast
majority of modifications have arisen&mdash;that is to say, he
has made us think we know the whole road, though he has almost
ostentatiously blindfolded us at every step of the journey.&nbsp;
But to the end of time, if the question be asked, &ldquo;Who
taught people to believe in evolution?&rdquo; there can only be
one answer&mdash;that it was Mr. Darwin.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Mivart urges with much force the difficulty of
<i>starting</i> any modification on which &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; is to work, and of getting a creature to vary in
any definite direction.&nbsp; Thus, after quoting from Mr.
Wallace some of the wonderful cases of &ldquo;mimicry&rdquo;
which are to be found among insects, he writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let us suppose that the ancestors of these various
animals were all destitute of the very special protection they at
present possess, as on the Darwinian hypothesis we must do.&nbsp;
Let it be also conceded that small deviations from the antecedent
colouring or form would tend to make some of their ancestors
escape destruction, by causing them more or less frequently to be
passed over or mistaken by their persecutors.&nbsp; Yet the
deviation must, as the event has shown, in each case, be in some
definite direction, whether it be towards some other animal or
plant, or towards some dead or inorganic matter.&nbsp; But as,
according to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory, there is a constant
tendency to indefinite variation, and as the minute incipient
variations will be <i>in all directions</i>, they must tend to
neutralise each other, and at first to form such unstable
modifications, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to see
how such indefinite modifications of insignificant beginnings can
ever build up a sufficiently appreciable resemblance to a leaf,
bamboo, or other object for &ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; to
seize upon and perpetuate.&nbsp; This difficulty is augmented
when we consider&mdash;a point to be dwelt upon
hereafter&mdash;how necessary it is that many individuals should
be similarly modified simultaneously.&nbsp; This has been
insisted on in an able article in the &lsquo;North British
Review&rsquo; for June 1867, p. 286, and the consideration of the
article has occasioned Mr. Darwin&rdquo; (&ldquo;Origin of
Species,&rdquo; 5th ed., p. 104) &ldquo;to make an important
modification in his views&rdquo; (&ldquo;Genesis of
Species,&rdquo; p. 38).</p>
<p>To this Mr. Darwin rejoins:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in all the foregoing cases the insects in their
original state, no doubt, presented some rude and accidental
resemblance to an object commonly found in the stations
frequented by them.&nbsp; Nor is this improbable, considering the
almost infinite number of surrounding objects, and the diversity
of form and colour of the host of insects that exist&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Natural Selection,&rdquo; p. 182, ed. 1876).</p>
<p>Mr. Mivart has just said: &ldquo;It is difficult to see how
such indefinite modifications of insignificant beginnings <i>can
ever build up a sufficiently appreciable resemblance to a
leaf</i>, <i>bamboo</i>, <i>or other object</i>, <i>for</i>
&lsquo;<i>natural selection</i>&rsquo; <i>to work
upon</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer is, that &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; did not
begin to work <i>until</i>, <i>from unknown causes</i>, <i>an
appreciable resemblance had nevertheless been
presented</i>.&nbsp; I think the reader will agree with me that
the development of the lowest life into a creature which bears
even &ldquo;a rude resemblance&rdquo; to the objects commonly
found in the station in which it is moving in its present
differentiation, requires more explanation than is given by the
word &ldquo;accidental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin continues: &ldquo;As some rude resemblance is
necessary for the first start,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and a little lower
he writes: &ldquo;Assuming that an insect originally happened to
resemble in some degree a dead twig or a decayed leaf, and that
it varied slightly in many ways, then all the variations which
rendered the insect at all more like any such object, and thus
favoured its escape, would be preserved, while other variations
would be neglected, and ultimately lost, or if they rendered the
insect at all less like the imitated object, they would be
eliminated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here, again, we are required to begin with Natural
Selection when the work is already in great part done, owing to
causes about which we are left completely in the dark; we may, I
think, fairly demur to the insects <i>originally</i> happening to
resemble in some degree a dead twig or a decayed leaf.&nbsp; And
when we bear in mind that the variations, being supposed by Mr.
Darwin to be indefinite, or devoid of aim, will appear in every
direction, we cannot forget what Mr. Mivart insists upon, namely,
that the chances of many favourable variations being counteracted
by other unfavourable ones in the same creature are not
inconsiderable.&nbsp; Nor, again, is it likely that the
favourable variation would make its mark upon the race, and
escape being absorbed in the course of a few generations,
unless&mdash;as Mr. Mivart elsewhere points out, in a passage to
which I shall call the reader&rsquo;s attention presently&mdash;a
larger number of similarly varying creatures made their
appearance at the same time than there seems sufficient reason to
anticipate, if the variations can be called fortuitous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would,&rdquo; continues Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;indeed
be force in Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s objection if we were to attempt to
account for the above resemblances, independently of
&lsquo;natural selection,&rsquo; through mere fluctuating
variability; but as the case stands, there is none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This comes to saying that, if there was no power in nature
which operates so that of all the many fluctuating variations,
those only are preserved which tend to the resemblance which is
beneficial to the creature, then indeed there would be difficulty
in understanding how the resemblance could have come about; but
that as there is a beneficial resemblance to start with, and as
there is a power in nature which would preserve and accumulate
further beneficial resemblance, should it arise from this cause
or that, the difficulty is removed.&nbsp; But Mr. Mivart does
not, I take it, deny the existence of such a power in nature, as
Mr. Darwin supposes, though, if I understand him rightly, he does
not see that its operation <i>upon small fortuitous
variations</i> is at all the simple and obvious process, which on
a superficial view of the case it would appear to be.&nbsp; He
thinks&mdash;and I believe the reader will agree with
him&mdash;that this process is too slow and too risky.&nbsp; What
he wants to know is, how the insect came even rudely to resemble
the object, and how, if its variations are indefinite, we are
ever to get into such a condition as to be able to report
progress, owing to the constant liability of the creature which
has varied favourably, to play the part of Penelope and undo its
work, by varying in some one of the infinite number of other
directions which are open to it&mdash;all of which, except this
one, tend to destroy the resemblance, and yet may be in some
other respect even more advantageous to the creature, and so tend
to its preservation.&nbsp; Moreover, here, too, I think (though I
cannot be sure), we have a recurrence of the original fallacy in
the words&mdash;&ldquo;If we were to account for the above
resemblances, independently of &lsquo;natural selection,&rsquo;
through mere fluctuating variability.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely Mr.
Darwin does, after all, &ldquo;account for the resemblances
through mere fluctuating variability,&rdquo; for &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; does not account for one single variation in the
whole list of them from first to last, other than indirectly, as
shewn in the preceding chapter.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to continue this subject further; but
I would beg the reader to refer to other paragraphs in the
neighbourhood of the one just quoted, in which he
may&mdash;though I do not think he will&mdash;see reason to think
that I should have given Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s answer more
fully.&nbsp; I do not quote Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s next paragraph,
inasmuch as I see no great difficulty about &ldquo;the last
touches of perfection in mimicry,&rdquo; provided Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s theory will account for any mimicry at all.&nbsp;
If it could do this, it might as well do more; but a strong
impression is left on my mind, that without the help of something
over and above the power to vary, which should give a definite
aim to variations, all the &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; in the
world would not have prevented stagnation and
self-stultification, owing to the indefinite tendency of the
variations, which thus could not have developed either a preyer
or a preyee, but would have gone round and round and round the
primordial cell till they were weary of it.</p>
<p>As against Mr. Darwin, therefore, I think that the objection
just given from Mr. Mivart is fatal.&nbsp; I believe, also, that
the reader will feel the force of it much more strongly if he
will turn to Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s own pages.&nbsp; Against the view
which I am myself supporting, the objection breaks down entirely,
for grant &ldquo;a little dose of judgement and reason&rdquo; on
the part of the creature itself&mdash;grant also continued
personality and memory&mdash;and a definite tendency is at once
given to the variations.&nbsp; The process is thus started, and
is kept straight, and helped forward through every stage by
&ldquo;the little dose of reason,&rdquo; &amp;c., which enabled
it to take its first step.&nbsp; We are, in fact, no longer
without a helm, but can steer each creature that is so
discontented with its condition, as to make a serious effort to
better itself, into <i>some</i>&mdash;and into a very
distant&mdash;harbour.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It has been objected against Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory that if
all species and genera have come to differ through the
accumulation of minute but&mdash;as a general
rule&mdash;fortuitous variations, there has not been time enough,
so far as we are able to gather, for the evolution of all
existing forms by so slow a process.&nbsp; On this subject I
would again refer the reader to Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s book, from
which I take the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir William Thompson has lately advanced arguments from
three distinct lines of inquiry agreeing in one approximate
result.&nbsp; The three lines of inquiry are&mdash;(1) the action
of the tides upon the earth&rsquo;s rotation; (2) the probable
length of time during which the sun has illuminated this planet;
and (3) the temperature of the interior of the earth.&nbsp; The
result arrived at by these investigations is a conclusion that
the existing state of things on the earth, life on the earth, all
geological history showing continuity of life, must be limited
within some such period of past time as one hundred million
years.&nbsp; The first question which suggests itself, supposing
Sir W. Thompson&rsquo;s views to be correct, is: Has this period
been anything like enough for the evolution of all organic forms
by &lsquo;natural selection&rsquo;?&nbsp; The second is: Has the
period been anything like enough for the deposition of the strata
which must have been deposited if all organic forms have been
evolved by minute steps, according to the Darwinian
theory?&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Genesis of Species,&rdquo; p.
154).</p>
<p>Mr. Mivart then quotes from Mr. Murphy&mdash;whose work I have
not seen&mdash;the following passage:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darwin justly mentions the greyhound as being equal to
any natural species in the perfect co-ordination of its parts,
&lsquo;all adapted for extreme fleetness and for running down
weak prey.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet it is an artificial species (and not
physiologically a species at all) formed by a long-continued
selection under domestication; and there is no reason to suppose
that any of the variations which have been selected to form it
have been other than gradual and almost imperceptible.&nbsp;
Suppose that it has taken five hundred years to form the
greyhound out of his wolf-like ancestor.&nbsp; This is a mere
guess, but it gives the order of magnitude.&nbsp; Now, if so, how
long would it take to obtain an elephant from a protozoon or even
from a tadpole-like fish?&nbsp; Ought it not to take much more
than a million times as long?&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Genesis of
Species,&rdquo; p. 155).</p>
<p>I should be very sorry to pronounce any opinion upon the
foregoing data; but a general impression is left upon my mind,
that if the differences between an elephant and a tadpole-like
fish have arisen from the accumulation of small variations that
have had no direction given them by intelligence and sense of
needs, then no time conceivable by man would suffice for their
development.&nbsp; But grant &ldquo;a little dose of reason and
judgement,&rdquo; even to animals low down in the scale of
nature, and grant this, not only during their later life, but
during their embryological existence, and see with what
infinitely greater precision of aim and with what increased speed
the variations would arise.&nbsp; Evolution entirely unaided by
inherent intelligence must be a very slow, if not quite
inconceivable, process.&nbsp; Evolution helped by intelligence
would still be slow, but not so desperately slow.&nbsp; One can
conceive that there has been sufficient time for the second, but
one cannot conceive it for the first.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I find from Mr. Mivart that objection has been taken to Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s views, on account of the great odds that exist
against the appearance of any given variation at one and the same
time, in a sufficient number of individuals, to prevent its being
obliterated almost as soon as produced by the admixture of
unvaried blood which would so greatly preponderate around it; and
indeed the necessity for a nearly simultaneous and similar
variation, or readiness so to vary on the part of many
individuals, seems almost a postulate for evolution at all.&nbsp;
On this subject Mr. Mivart writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;North British Review&rsquo; (speaking of the
supposition that species is changed by the survival of a few
individuals in a century through a similar and favourable
variation) says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is very difficult to see how this can be
accomplished, even when the variation is eminently favourable
indeed; and still more, when the advantage gained is very slight,
as must generally be the case.&nbsp; The advantage, whatever it
may be, is utterly outbalanced by numerical inferiority.&nbsp; A
million creatures are born; ten thousand survive to produce
offspring.&nbsp; One of the million has twice as good a chance as
any other of surviving, but the chances are fifty to one against
the gifted individuals being one of the hundred survivors.&nbsp;
No doubt the chances are twice as great against any other
individual, but this does not prevent their being enormously in
favour of <i>some</i> average individual.&nbsp; However slight
the advantage may be, if it is shared by half the individuals
produced, it will probably be present in at least fifty-one of
the survivors, and in a larger proportion of their offspring; but
the chances are against the preservation of any one
&ldquo;sport&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, sudden marked variation) in a
numerous tribe.&nbsp; The vague use of an imperfectly-understood
doctrine of chance, has led Darwinian supporters, first, to
confuse the two cases above distinguished, and secondly, to
imagine that a very slight balance in favour of some individual
sport must lead to its perpetuation.&nbsp; All that can be said
is that in the above example the favoured sport would be
preserved once in fifty times.&nbsp; Let us consider what will be
its influence on the main stock when preserved.&nbsp; It will
breed and have a progeny of say 100; now this progeny will, on
the whole, be intermediate between the average individual and the
sport.&nbsp; The odds in favour of one of this generation of the
new breed will be, say one and a half to one, as compared with
the average individual; the odds in their favour will, therefore,
be less than that of their parents; but owing to their greater
number the chances are that about one and a half of them would
survive.&nbsp; Unless these breed together&mdash;a most
improbable event&mdash;their progeny would again approach the
average individual; there would be 150 of them, and their
superiority would be, say in the ratio of one and a quarter to
one; the probability would now be that nearly two of them would
survive, and have 200 children with an eighth superiority.&nbsp;
Rather more than two of these would survive; but the superiority
would again dwindle; until after a few generations it would no
longer be observed, and would count for no more in the struggle
for life than any of the hundred trifling advantages which occur
in the ordinary organs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An illustration will bring this conception
home.&nbsp; Suppose a white man to have been wrecked on an island
inhabited by negroes, and to have established himself in friendly
relations with a powerful tribe, whose customs he has
learnt.&nbsp; Suppose him to possess the physical strength,
energy, and ability of a dominant white race, and let the food of
the island suit his constitution; grant him every advantage which
we can conceive a white to possess over the native; concede that
in the struggle for existence, his chance of a long life will be
much superior to that of the native chiefs; yet from all these
admissions there does not follow the conclusion, that after a
limited or unlimited number of generations, the inhabitants of
the island will be white.&nbsp; Our shipwrecked hero would
probably become king; he would kill a great many blacks in the
struggle for existence; he would have a great many wives and
children . . . In the first generation there will be some dozens
of intelligent young mulattoes, much superior in average
intelligence to the negroes.&nbsp; We might expect the throne for
some generations to be occupied by a more or less yellow king;
but can any one believe that the whole island will gradually
acquire a white, or even a yellow population? . . . Darwin says,
that in the struggle for life a grain may turn the balance in
favour of a given structure, which will then be preserved.&nbsp;
But one of the weights in the scale of nature is due to the
number of a given tribe.&nbsp; Let there be 7000 A&rsquo;s and
7000 B&rsquo;s representing two varieties of a given animal, and
let all the B&rsquo;s, in virtue of a slight difference of
structure, have the better chance by one-thousandth part.&nbsp;
We must allow that there is a slight probability that the
descendants of B will supplant the descendants of A; but let
there be 7001 A&rsquo;s against 7000 B&rsquo;s at first, and the
chances are once more equal, while if there be 7002 A&rsquo;s to
start, the odds would be laid on the A&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Thus they
stand a greater chance of being killed; but, then, they can
better afford to be killed.&nbsp; The grain will only turn the
scales when these are very nicely balanced, and an advantage in
numbers counts for weight, even as an advantage in
structure.&nbsp; As the numbers of the favoured variety diminish,
so must its relative advantages increase, if the chance of its
existence is to surpass the chance of its extinction, until
hardly any conceivable advantage would enable the descendants of
a single pair to exterminate the descendants of many thousands,
if they and their descendants are supposed to breed freely with
the inferior variety, and so gradually lose their
ascendancy,&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;North British Review,&rdquo;
June 1867, p. 286 &ldquo;Genesis of Species,&rdquo; p. 64, and
onwards).</p>
<p>Against this it should be remembered that there is always an
antecedent probability that several specimens of a given
variation would appear at one time and place.&nbsp; This would
probably be the case even on Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s hypothesis, that
the variations are fortuitous; if they are mainly guided by sense
of need and intelligence, it would almost certainly be so, for
all would have much the same idea as to their well-being, and the
same cause which would lead one to vary in this direction would
lead not a few others to do so at the same time, or to follow
suit.&nbsp; Thus we see that many human ideas and inventions have
been conceived independently but simultaneously.&nbsp; The
chances, moreover, of specimens that have varied successfully,
intermarrying, are, I think, greater than the reviewer above
quoted from would admit.&nbsp; I believe that on the hypothesis
that the variations are fortuitous, and certainly on the
supposition that they are intelligent, they might be looked for
in members of the same family, who would hence have a better
chance of finding each other out.&nbsp; Serious as is the
difficulty advanced by the reviewer as against Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
theory, it may be in great measure parried without departing from
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s own position, but the &ldquo;little dose of
judgement and reason&rdquo; removes it, absolutely and
entirely.&nbsp; As for the reviewer&rsquo;s shipwrecked hero,
surely the reviewer must know that Mr. Darwin would no more
expect an island of black men to be turned white, or even
perceptibly whitened after a few generations, than the reviewer
himself would do so.&nbsp; But if we turn from what
&ldquo;might&rdquo; or what &ldquo;would&rdquo; happen to what
&ldquo;does&rdquo; happen, we find that a few white families have
nearly driven the Indian from the United States, the Australian
natives from Australia, and the Maories from New Zealand.&nbsp;
True, these few families have been helped by immigration; but it
will be admitted that this has only accelerated a result which
would otherwise, none the less surely, have been effected.</p>
<p>There is all the difference between a sudden sport, or even a
variety introduced from a foreign source, and the gradual,
intelligent, and, in the main, steady, growth of a race towards
ends always a little, but not much, in advance of what it can at
present compass, until it has reached equilibrium with its
surroundings.&nbsp; So far as Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s variations are
of the nature of &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, rare, and
owing to nothing that we can in the least assign to any known
cause, the reviewer&rsquo;s objections carry much weight.&nbsp;
Against the view here advocated, they are powerless.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I cannot here go into the difficulties of the geologic record,
but they too will, I believe, be felt to be almost infinitely
simplified by supposing the development of structure and instinct
to be guided by intelligence and memory, which, even under
unstable conditions, would be able to meet in some measure the
demands made upon them.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When Mr. Mivart deals with evolution and ethics, I am afraid
that I differ from him even more widely than I have done from Mr.
Darwin.&nbsp; He writes (&ldquo;Genesis of Species,&rdquo; p.
234): &ldquo;That &lsquo;natural selection&rsquo; could not have
produced from the sensations of pleasure and pain experienced by
brutes a higher degree of morality than was useful; therefore it
could have produced any amount of &lsquo;beneficial
habits,&rsquo; but not abhorrence of certain acts as impure and
sinful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; may not be able to do
much in the way of accumulating variations that do not arise; but
that, according to the views supported in this volume, all that
is highest and most beautiful in the soul, as well as in the
body, could be, and has been, developed from beings lower than
man, I do not greatly doubt.&nbsp; Mr. Mivart and myself should
probably differ as to what is and what is not beautiful.&nbsp;
Thus he writes of &ldquo;the noble virtue of a Marcus
Aurelius&rdquo; (p. 235), than whom, for my own part, I know few
respectable figures in history to whom I am less attracted.&nbsp;
I cannot but think that Mr. Mivart has taken his estimate of this
emperor at second-hand, and without reference to the writings
which happily enable us to form a fair estimate of his real
character.</p>
<p>Take the opening paragraphs of the &ldquo;Thoughts&rdquo; of
Marcus Aurelius, as translated by Mr. Long:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the reputation and remembrance of my father [I
learned] modesty and a manly character; from my mother, piety and
beneficence, abstinence not only from evil deeds, but even from
evil thoughts. . . .&nbsp; From my great-grandfather, not to have
frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home,
and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally . .
. From Diognetus . . . [I learned] to have become intimate with
philosophy, . . . and to have written dialogues in my youth, and
to have desired a plank bed and skin, and whatever else of the
kind belongs to the Greek discipline. . . .&nbsp; From Rusticus I
received the impression that my character required improvement
and discipline;&rdquo; and so on to the end of the chapter, near
which, however, it is right to say that there appears a redeeming
touch, in so far as that he thanks the gods that he could not
write poetry, and that he had never occupied himself about the
appearance of things in the heavens.</p>
<p>Or, again, opening Mr. Long&rsquo;s translation at random I
find (p. 37):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As physicians have always their instruments and knives
ready for cases which suddenly require their skill, so do thou
have principles ready for the understanding of things divine and
human, and for doing everything, even the smallest, with a
recollection of the bond that unites the divine and human to one
another.&nbsp; For neither wilt thou do anything well which
pertains to man without at the same time having a reference to
things divine; nor the contrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unhappy one!&nbsp; No wonder the Roman empire went to pieces
soon after him.&nbsp; If I remember rightly, he established and
subsidised professorships in all parts of his dominions.&nbsp;
Whereon the same befell the arts and literature of Rome as befell
Italian painting after the Academic system had taken root at
Bologna under the Caracci.&nbsp; Mr. Martin Tupper, again, is an
amiable and well-meaning man, but we should hardly like to see
him in Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; The Athenians
poisoned Socrates; and Aristophanes&mdash;than whom few more
profoundly religious men have ever been born&mdash;did not, so
far as we can gather, think the worse of his countrymen on that
account.&nbsp; It is not improbable that if they had poisoned
Plato too, Aristophanes would have been well enough pleased; but
I think he would have preferred either of these two men to Marcus
Aurelius.</p>
<p>I know nothing about the loving but manly devotion of a St.
Lewis, but I strongly suspect that Mr. Mivart has taken him, too,
upon hearsay.</p>
<p>On the other hand, among dogs we find examples of every heroic
quality, and of all that is most perfectly charming to us in
man.</p>
<p>As for the possible development of the more brutal human
natures from the more brutal instincts of the lower animals,
those who read a horrible story told in a note, pp. 233, 234 of
Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genesis of Species,&rdquo; will feel no
difficulty on that score.&nbsp; I must admit, however, that the
telling of that story seems to me to be a mistake in a
philosophical work, which should not, I think, unless under
compulsion, deal either with the horrors of the French
Revolution&mdash;or of the Spanish or Italian Inquisition.</p>
<p>For the rest of Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s objections, I must refer
the reader to his own work.&nbsp; I have been unable to find a
single one, which I do not believe to be easily met by the
Lamarckian view, with the additions (if indeed they are
additions, for I must own to no very profound knowledge of what
Lamarck did or did not say), which I have in this volume proposed
to make to it.&nbsp; At the same time I admit, that as against
the Darwinian view, many of them seem quite unanswerable.</p>
<h2><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCLUDING REMARKS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Here</span>, then, I leave my case, though
well aware that I have crossed the threshold only of my
subject.&nbsp; My work is of a tentative character, put before
the public as a sketch or design for a, possibly, further
endeavour, in which I hope to derive assistance from the
criticisms which this present volume may elicit.&nbsp; Such as it
is, however, for the present I must leave it.</p>
<p>We have seen that we cannot do anything thoroughly till we can
do it unconsciously, and that we cannot do anything unconsciously
till we can do it thoroughly; this at first seems illogical; but
logic and consistency are luxuries for the gods, and the lower
animals, only.&nbsp; Thus a boy cannot really know how to swim
till he can swim, but he cannot swim till he knows how to
swim.&nbsp; Conscious effort is but the process of rubbing off
the rough corners from these two contradictory statements, till
they eventually fit into one another so closely that it is
impossible to disjoin them.</p>
<p>Whenever, therefore, we see any creature able to go through
any complicated and difficult process with little or no
effort&mdash;whether it be a bird building her nest, or a
hen&rsquo;s egg making itself into a chicken, or an ovum turning
itself into a baby&mdash;we may conclude that the creature has
done the same thing on a very great number of past occasions.</p>
<p>We found the phenomena exhibited by heredity to be so like
those of memory, and to be so utterly inexplicable on any other
supposition, that it was easier to suppose them due to memory in
spite of the fact that we cannot remember having recollected,
than to believe that because we cannot so remember, therefore the
phenomena cannot be due to memory.</p>
<p>We were thus led to consider &ldquo;personal identity,&rdquo;
in order to see whether there was sufficient reason for denying
that the experience, which we must have clearly gained somewhere,
was gained by us when we were in the persons of our forefathers;
we found, not without surprise, that unless we admitted that it
might be so gained, in so far as that we once <i>actually
were</i> our remotest ancestor, we must change our ideas
concerning personality altogether.</p>
<p>We therefore assumed that the phenomena of heredity, whether
as regards instinct or structure were mainly due to memory of
past experiences, accumulated and fused till they had become
automatic, or quasi automatic, much in the same way as after a
long life&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">. . . &ldquo;Old experience do attain<br />
To something like prophetic strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dealing with certain phenomena of memory, but more
especially with its abeyance and revival, we inquired what the
principal corresponding phenomena of life and species should be,
on the hypothesis that they were mainly due to memory.</p>
<p>I think I may say that we found the hypothesis fit in with
actual facts in a sufficiently satisfactory manner.&nbsp; We
found not a few matters, as, for example, the sterility of
hybrids, the phenomena of old age, and puberty as generally near
the end of development, explain themselves with more completeness
than I have yet heard of their being explained on any other
hypothesis.</p>
<p>We considered the most important difficulty in the way of
instinct as hereditary habit, namely, the structure and instincts
of neuter insects; these are very unlike those of their parents,
and cannot apparently be transmitted to offspring by individuals
of the previous generation, in whom such structure and instincts
appeared, inasmuch as these creatures are sterile.&nbsp; I do not
say that the difficulty is wholly removed, inasmuch as some
obscurity must be admitted to remain as to the manner in which
the structure of the larva is aborted; this obscurity is likely
to remain till we know more of the early history of civilisation
among bees than I can find that we know at present; but I believe
the difficulty was reduced to such proportions as to make it
little likely to be felt in comparison with that of attributing
instinct to any other cause than inherited habit, or inherited
habit modified by changed conditions.</p>
<p>We then inquired what was the great principle underlying
variation, and answered, with Lamarck, that it must be
&ldquo;sense of need;&rdquo; and though not without being haunted
by suspicion of a vicious circle, and also well aware that we
were not much nearer the origin of life than when we started, we
still concluded that here was the truest origin of species, and
hence of genera; and that the accumulation of variations, which
in time amounted to specific and generic differences, was due to
intelligence and memory on the part of the creature varying,
rather than to the operation of what Mr. Darwin has called
&ldquo;natural selection.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same time we
admitted that the course of nature is very much as Mr. Darwin has
represented it, in this respect, in so far as that there is a
struggle for existence, and that the weaker must go to the
wall.&nbsp; But we denied that this part of the course of nature
would lead to much, if any, accumulation of variation, unless the
variation was directed mainly by intelligent sense of need, with
continued personality and memory.</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that the small, structureless,
impregnate ovum from which we have each one of us sprung, has a
potential recollection of all that has happened to each one of
its ancestors prior to the period at which any such ancestor has
issued from the bodies of its progenitors&mdash;provided, that is
to say, a sufficiently deep, or sufficiently often-repeated,
impression has been made to admit of its being remembered at
all.</p>
<p>Each step of normal development will lead the impregnate ovum
up to, and remind it of, its next ordinary course of action, in
the same way as we, when we recite a well-known passage, are led
up to each successive sentence by the sentence which has
immediately preceded it.</p>
<p>And for this reason, namely, that as it takes two people
&ldquo;to tell&rdquo; a thing&mdash;a speaker and a comprehending
listener, without which last, though much may have been said,
there has been nothing told&mdash;so also it takes two people, as
it were, to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; a thing&mdash;the creature
remembering, and the surroundings of the creature at the time it
last remembered.&nbsp; Hence, though the ovum immediately after
impregnation is instinct with all the memories of both parents,
not one of these memories can normally become active till both
the ovum itself, and its surroundings, are sufficiently like what
they respectively were, when the occurrence now to be remembered
last took place.&nbsp; The memory will then immediately return,
and the creature will do as it did on the last occasion that it
was in like case as now.&nbsp; This ensures that similarity of
order shall be preserved in all the stages of development, in
successive generations.</p>
<p>Life, then, is faith founded upon experience, which experience
is in its turn founded upon faith&mdash;or more simply, it is
memory.&nbsp; Plants and animals only differ from one another
because they remember different things; plants and animals only
grow up in the shapes they assume because this shape is their
memory, their idea concerning their own past history.</p>
<p>Hence the term &ldquo;Natural History,&rdquo; as applied to
the different plants and animals around us.&nbsp; For surely the
study of natural history means only the study of plants and
animals themselves, which, at the moment of using the words
&ldquo;Natural History,&rdquo; we assume to be the most important
part of nature.</p>
<p>A living creature well supported by a mass of healthy
ancestral memory is a young and growing creature, free from ache
or pain, and thoroughly acquainted with its business so far, but
with much yet to be reminded of.&nbsp; A creature which finds
itself and its surroundings not so unlike those of its parents
about the time of their begetting it, as to be compelled to
recognise that it never yet was in any such position, is a
creature in the heyday of life.&nbsp; A creature which begins to
be aware of itself is one which is beginning to recognise that
the situation is a new one.</p>
<p>It is the young and fair, then, who are the truly old and the
truly experienced; it is they who alone have a trustworthy memory
to guide them; they alone know things as they are, and it is from
them that, as we grow older, we must study if we would still
cling to truth.&nbsp; The whole charm of youth lies in its
advantage over age in respect of experience, and where this has
for some reason failed, or been misapplied, the charm is
broken.&nbsp; When we say that we are getting old, we should say
rather that we are getting new or young, and are suffering from
inexperience, which drives us into doing things which we do not
understand, and lands us, eventually, in the utter impotence of
death.&nbsp; The kingdom of heaven is the kingdom of little
children.</p>
<p>A living creature bereft of all memory dies.&nbsp; If bereft
of a great part of memory, it swoons or sleeps; and when its
memory returns, we say it has returned to life.</p>
<p>Life and death, then, should be memory and forgetfulness, for
we are dead to all that we have forgotten.</p>
<p>Life is that property of matter whereby it can remember.&nbsp;
Matter which can remember is living; matter which cannot remember
is dead.</p>
<p><i>Life</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>is memory</i>.&nbsp; The life of
a creature is the memory of a creature.&nbsp; We are all the same
stuff to start with, but we remember different things, and if we
did not remember different things we should be absolutely like
each other.&nbsp; As for the stuff itself of which we are made,
we know nothing save only that it is &ldquo;such as dreams are
made of.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am aware that there are many expressions throughout this
book, which are not scientifically accurate.&nbsp; Thus I imply
that we tend towards the centre of the earth, when, I believe, I
should say we tend towards to the centre of gravity of the
earth.&nbsp; I speak of &ldquo;the primordial cell,&rdquo; when I
mean only the earliest form of life, and I thus not only assume a
single origin of life when there is no necessity for doing so,
and perhaps no evidence to this effect, but I do so in spite of
the fact that the am&oelig;ba, which seems to be &ldquo;the
simplest form of life,&rdquo; does not appear to be a cell at
all.&nbsp; I have used the word &ldquo;beget,&rdquo; of what, I
am told, is asexual generation, whereas the word should be
confined to sexual generation only.&nbsp; Many more such errors
have been pointed out to me, and I doubt not that a larger number
remain of which I know nothing now, but of which I may perhaps be
told presently.</p>
<p>I did not, however, think that in a work of this description
the additional words which would have been required for
scientific accuracy were worth the paper and ink and loss of
breadth which their introduction would entail.&nbsp; Besides, I
know nothing about science, and it is as well that there should
be no mistake on this head; I neither know, nor want to know,
more detail than is necessary to enable me to give a fairly broad
and comprehensive view of my subject.&nbsp; When for the purpose
of giving this, a matter importunately insisted on being made
out, I endeavoured to make it out as well as I could;
otherwise&mdash;that is to say, if it did not insist on being
looked into, in spite of a good deal of snubbing, I held that, as
it was blurred and indistinct in nature, I had better so render
it in my work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if one has gone for some time through a wood
full of burrs, some of them are bound to stick.&nbsp; I am afraid
that I have left more such burrs in one part and another of my
book, than the kind of reader whom I alone wish to please will
perhaps put up with.&nbsp; Fortunately, this kind of reader is
the best-natured critic in the world, and is long suffering of a
good deal that the more consciously scientific will not tolerate;
I wish, however, that I had not used such expressions as
&ldquo;centres of thought and action&rdquo; quite so often.</p>
<p>As for the kind of inaccuracy already alluded to, my reader
will not, I take it, as a general rule, know, or wish to know,
much more about science than I do, sometimes perhaps even less;
so that he and I shall commonly be wrong in the same places, and
our two wrongs will make a sufficiently satisfactory right for
practical purposes.</p>
<p>Of course, if I were a specialist writing a treatise or primer
on such and such a point of detail, I admit that scientific
accuracy would be <i>de rigueur</i>; but I have been trying to
paint a picture rather than to make a diagram, and I claim the
painter&rsquo;s license &ldquo;<i>quidlibet
audendi</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have done my utmost to give the
spirit of my subject, but if the letter interfered with the
spirit, I have sacrificed it without remorse.</p>
<p>May not what is commonly called a scientific subject have
artistic value which it is a pity to neglect?&nbsp; But if a
subject is to be treated artistically&mdash;that is to say, with
a desire to consider not only the facts, but the way in which the
reader will feel concerning those facts, and the way in which he
will wish to see them rendered, thus making his mind a factor of
the intention, over and above the subject itself&mdash;then the
writer must not be denied a painter&rsquo;s license.&nbsp; If one
is painting a hillside at a sufficient distance, and cannot see
whether it is covered with chestnut-trees or walnuts, one is not
bound to go across the valley to see.&nbsp; If one is painting a
city, it is not necessary that one should know the names of the
streets.&nbsp; If a house or tree stands inconveniently for
one&rsquo;s purpose, it must go without more ado; if two
important features, neither of which can be left out, want a
little bringing together or separating before the spirit of the
place can be well given, they must be brought together, or
separated.&nbsp; Which is a more truthful view, of Shrewsbury,
for example, from a spot where St. Alkmund&rsquo;s spire is in
parallax with St. Mary&rsquo;s&mdash;a view which should give
only the one spire which can be seen, or one which should give
them both, although the one is hidden?&nbsp; There would be, I
take it, more representation in the misrepresentation than in the
representation&mdash;&ldquo;the half would be greater than the
whole,&rdquo; unless, that is to say, one expressly told the
spectator that St. Alkmund&rsquo;s spire was hidden behind St.
Mary&rsquo;s&mdash;a sort of explanation which seldom adds to the
poetical value of any work of art.&nbsp; Do what one may, and no
matter how scientific one may be, one cannot attain absolute
truth.&nbsp; The question is rather, how do people like to have
their error? than, will they go without any error at all?&nbsp;
All truth and no error cannot be given by the scientist more than
by the artist; each has to sacrifice truth in one way or another;
and even if perfect truth could be given, it is doubtful whether
it would not resolve itself into unconsciousness pure and simple,
consciousness being, as it were, the clash of small conflicting
perceptions, without which there is neither intelligence nor
recollection possible.&nbsp; It is not, then, what a man has
said, nor what he has put down with actual paint upon his
canvass, which speaks to us with living language&mdash;<i>it is
what he has thought to us</i> (as is so well put in the letter
quoted on page 83), by which our opinion should be
guided;&mdash;what has he made us feel that he had it in him, and
wished to do?&nbsp; If he has said or painted enough to make us
feel that he meant and felt as we should wish him to have done,
he has done the utmost that man can hope to do.</p>
<p>I feel sure that no additional amount of technical accuracy
would make me more likely to succeed, in this respect, if I have
otherwise failed; and as this is the only success about which I
greatly care, I have left my scientific inaccuracies uncorrected,
even when aware of them.&nbsp; At the same time, I should say
that I have taken all possible pains as regards anything which I
thought could materially affect the argument one way or
another.</p>
<p>It may be said that I have fallen between two stools, and that
the subject is one which, in my hands, has shown neither artistic
nor scientific value.&nbsp; This would be serious.&nbsp; To fall
between two stools, and to be hanged for a lamb, are the two
crimes which&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nor gods, nor men, nor any schools
allow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the latter, I go in but little danger; about the former, I
shall know better when the public have enlightened me.</p>
<p>The practical value of the views here advanced (if they be
admitted as true at all) would appear to be not inconsiderable,
alike as regards politics or the well-being of the community, and
medicine which deals with that of the individual.&nbsp; In the
first case we see the rationale of compromise, and the equal
folly of making experiments upon too large a scale, and of not
making them at all.&nbsp; We see that new ideas cannot be fused
with old, save gradually and by patiently leading up to them in
such a way as to admit of a sense of continued identity between
the old and the new.&nbsp; This should teach us moderation.&nbsp;
For even though nature wishes to travel in a certain direction,
she insists on being allowed to take her own time; she will not
be hurried, and will cull a creature out even more surely for
forestalling her wishes too readily, than for lagging a little
behind them.&nbsp; So the greatest musicians, painters, and poets
owe their greatness rather to their fusion and assimilation of
all the good that has been done up to, and especially near about,
their own time, than to any very startling steps they have taken
in advance.&nbsp; Such men will be sure to take some, and
important, steps forward; for unless they have this power, they
will not be able to assimilate well what has been done already,
and if they have it, their study of older work will almost
indefinitely assist it; but, on the whole, they owe their
greatness to their completer fusion and assimilation of older
ideas; for nature is distinctly a fairly liberal conservative
rather than a conservative liberal.&nbsp; All which is well said
in the old couplet&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Be not the first by whom the new is
tried,<br />
Nor yet the last to throw the old aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the above would seem to hold as truly
about medicine as about politics.&nbsp; We cannot reason with our
cells, for they know so much more than we do that they cannot
understand us;&mdash;but though we cannot reason with them, we
can find out what they have been most accustomed to, and what,
therefore, they are most likely to expect; we can see that they
get this, as far as it is in our power to give it them, and may
then generally leave the rest to them, only bearing in mind that
they will rebel equally against too sudden a change of treatment,
and no change at all.</p>
<p>Friends have complained to me that they can never tell whether
I am in jest or earnest.&nbsp; I think, however, it should be
sufficiently apparent that I am in very serious earnest, perhaps
too much so, from the first page of my book to the last.&nbsp; I
am not aware of a single argument put forward which is not a
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> argument, although, perhaps, sometimes
admitting of a humorous side.&nbsp; If a grain of corn looks like
a piece of chaff, I confess I prefer it occasionally to something
which looks like a grain, but which turns out to be a piece of
chaff only.&nbsp; There is no lack of matter of this description
going about in some very decorous volumes; I have, therefore,
endeavoured, for a third time, to furnish the public with a book
whose fault should lie rather in the direction of seeming less
serious than it is, than of being less so than it seems.</p>
<p>At the same time, I admit that when I began to write upon my
subject I did not seriously believe in it.&nbsp; I saw, as it
were, a pebble upon the ground, with a sheen that pleased me;
taking it up, I turned it over and over for my amusement, and
found it always grow brighter and brighter the more I examined
it.&nbsp; At length I became fascinated, and gave loose rein to
self-illusion.&nbsp; The aspect of the world seemed changed; the
trifle which I had picked up idly had proved to be a talisman of
inestimable value, and had opened a door through which I caught
glimpses of a strange and interesting transformation.&nbsp; Then
came one who told me that the stone was not mine, but that it had
been dropped by Lamarck, to whom it belonged rightfully, but who
had lost it; whereon I said I cared not who was the owner, if
only I might use it and enjoy it.&nbsp; Now, therefore, having
polished it with what art and care one who is no jeweller could
bestow upon it, I return it, as best I may, to its possessor.</p>
<p>What am I to think or say?&nbsp; That I tried to deceive
others till I have fallen a victim to my own falsehood?&nbsp;
Surely this is the most reasonable conclusion to arrive at.&nbsp;
Or that I have really found Lamarck&rsquo;s talisman, which had
been for some time lost sight of?</p>
<p>Will the reader bid me wake with him to a world of chance and
blindness?&nbsp; Or can I persuade him to dream with me of a more
living faith than either he or I had as yet conceived as
possible?&nbsp; As I have said, reason points remorselessly to an
awakening, but faith and hope still beckon to the dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> I may say in passing that
though articulate speech and the power to maintain the upright
position come much about the same time, yet the power of making
gestures of more or less significance is prior to that of walking
uprightly, and therefore to that of speech.&nbsp; Not only is
gesticulation the earlier faculty in the individual, but it was
so also in the history of our race.&nbsp; Our semi-simious
ancestors could gesticulate long before they could talk
articulately.&nbsp; It is significant of this that gesture is
still found easier than speech even by adults, as may be observed
on our river steamers, where the captain moves his hand but does
not speak, a boy interpreting his gesture into language.&nbsp; To
develop this here would complicate the argument; let us be
content to note it and pass on.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the smallness of the effort touches upon the
deepest mystery of organic life&mdash;the power to originate, to
err, to sport, the power which differentiates the living organism
from the machine, however complicated.&nbsp; The action and
working of this power is found to be like the action of any other
mental and, therefore, physical power (for all physical action of
living beings is but the expression of a mental action), but I
can throw no light upon its origin any more than upon the origin
of life.&nbsp; This, too, must be noted and passed over.</p>

<p>How different from the above uncertain sound is the full clear
note of one who truly believes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church of England is commonly called a Lutheran
church, but whoever compares it with the Lutheran churches on the
Continent will have reason to congratulate himself on its
superiority.&nbsp; It is in fact a church <i>sui generis</i>,
yielding in point of dignity, purity and decency of its
doctrines, establishment and ceremonies, to no congregation of
christians in the world; modelled to a certain and considerable
extent, but not entirely, by our great and wise pious reformers
on the doctrines of Luther, so far as they are in conformity with
the sure and solid foundation on which it rests, and we trust for
ever will rest&mdash;the authority of the Holy Scriptures, Jesus
Christ himself being the chief corner stone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Sketch of Modern and Ancient Geography,&rdquo; by Dr.
Samuel Butler, of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Ed. 1813.)</p>
<p>This is the language of faith, compelled by the exigencies of
the occasion to be for a short time conscious of its own
existence, but surely very little likely to become so to the
extent of feeling the need of any assistance from reason.&nbsp;
It is the language of one whose convictions are securely founded
upon the current opinion of those among whom he has been born and
bred; and of all merely post-natal faiths a faith so founded is
the strongest.&nbsp; It is pleasing to see that the only
alterations in the edition of 1838 consist in spelling Christians
with a capital C and the omission of the epithet
&ldquo;wise&rdquo; as applied to the reformers, an omission more
probably suggested by a desire for euphony than by any nascent
doubts concerning the applicability of the epithet itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Or</span> take, again, the constitution of
the Church of England.&nbsp; The bishops are the spiritual
queens, the clergy are the neuter workers.&nbsp; They differ
widely in structure (for dress must be considered as a part of
structure), in the delicacy of the food they eat and the kind of
house they inhabit, and also in many of their instincts, from the
bishops, who are their spiritual parents.&nbsp; Not only this,
but there are two distinct kinds of neuter workers&mdash;priests
and deacons; and of the former there are deans, archdeacons,
prebends, canons, rural deans, vicars, rectors, curates, yet all
spiritually sterile.&nbsp; In spite of this sterility, however,
is there anyone who will maintain that the widely differing
structures and instincts of these castes are not due to inherited
spiritual habit?&nbsp; Still less will he be inclined to do so
when he reflects that by such slight modification of treatment as
consecration and endowment any one of them can be rendered
spiritually fertile.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
