description: Published in 1878, this is the first book in which Butler attacks Darwinism,
  and sets out an alternative, neo-Lamarckian theory which explores the role of memory
  in shaping organisms. Butler initially wrote the book as a tribute and complement
  to Darwin's theory. Darwin chose to ignore the attack, but Butler continued to challenge
  the scientific establishment with three additional books.
